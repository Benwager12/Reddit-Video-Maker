It was one of those that was shown on Film4 (UK channel) at stupid o'clock in the morning and I can't remember for the life of me what it was called. It had a basic Cluedo/Agatha Christie setup - bunch of relatives gathered together in  a house (in winter maybe, but this might be wrong), the father/grandfather dies and they all have to figure out who did it. I *think* it had moments of humour in it, despite not being an out-and-out comedy.\n\nIt wasn't an old film - definitely post 2000 and was set in the modern age so wasn't a period detective story or anything. \n\nOne of the characters (suspects?) was a red-headed woman with glasses who seemed to enjoy terrible romantic fiction.\n\nSpoiler for the end if I've remembered correctly -  &gt;!I have a feeling that maybe the old man turned out to not have been dead all along and that he was maybe faking it to find something out about his relatives?!&lt;\n\nI can't find any hint of this film at all.

While most of those are well-known enough to be easy to find today, one of them has seemingly been erased from existence.\n\nBased on what I can remember, the song in question was a slow, largely incomprehensible reimagining of \"The Twelve Days of Christmas.\" It was ostensibly performed by either Chip and Dale (of *Rescue Rangers* fame) or David Seville with a malfunctioning tape-recorder. (Also, no, it wasn't the version of the song which features Alvin shouting \"*I'm getting tired, Dave!*\" toward the end.) I was maybe seven years old when I last heard the piece, and to this day, I have literally no idea what the lyrics were.\n\nNow, that last claim probably seems ridiculous in the context of discussing a Christmas carol, but honestly, the song sounded like it had somehow managed to rearrange several important syllables. As those chipmunk-like voices sang, all I could hear was this:\n\n&gt;On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...     \n&gt;A part-eating swan... fir... treeeeeeee...\n&gt;\n&gt;On the first... day of... Christmas... my true love... gave to me...     \n&gt;A part... eat... ing... swan... fir... treeeeeeee...\n\nThis unintelligible mess continued for several virtually identical verses, then suddenly transformed into a strange bastardization of a more-familiar melody:\n\n&gt;Six geese a-laying     \n&gt;Eight maids a-milking     \n&gt;And a partridge in a pear tree\n\nAnyway, my memories have almost certainly been altered by time, and for all I know, the indecipherable nature of the song was the result of a low-quality recording. Even so, I'd really like to hear it again, if only to finally experience a holiday wherein I'm not haunted by the frustrating memory of trying to decipher the lyrics.\n\n**TL;DR: There are chipmunks in my head, and I want to evict them.**"}, {"author": "zxTheIronLungxz", "score": "1", "created": "15 minutes", "comment": "The purchase link for those stupid \"nintendo switch\" light switch gag gifts"}, {"author": "Emergency_Paperclip", "score": "1", "created": "13 minutes", "comment": "I tried to find the browser games I played when I was a kid.
