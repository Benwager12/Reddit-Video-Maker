They were finally finished getting de-iced and about to start taxiing when one of the passengers called her over and told her that he'd been watching carefully and he didn't think they'd de-iced both wings of the plane, just one side. She sort of reassured him that she would go check but he was probably mistaken, and then even though she was really tempted to wave it off as just a jumpy passenger, she went to the pilot just to check.\n\nWelp! Passenger was correct and the plane was only half de-iced when they were getting ready to leave. If they'd taken off like that, it probably would have been disastrous.

We had about 2 and a half hours until we could reach any kind of land. We had a new hire (2 months?) working the flight that got very emotional and started saying things like \"I don't want to die\" in a panicked voice. We had to shush her so passengers wouldn't start freaking out. As time progressed I tried to ignore the fact that the other engine could crap out or we could have a bird strike or any number of things could go wrong. I started casually going through the cabin and rechecking all of the emergency equipment on board. To calm the new hire down I took her through with me to try and remind her of her training.  Just as she started calming down I notice a strange noise coming from the functioning engine. It was the sound it makes when we are changing speeds around the time we are about to land. We were still 1 hour 40 minutes out. The captain gives us another call and my heart sank.  Just as he called a passenger gets up out of his seat and collapses right in the aisle. His shirt caught on the arm rest and ripped his shirt wide open. His wife screams. There are 4 flight attendants on this flight so someone else answered the call from the captain and I had to deal with this. In my mind I am thinking \"how am I going to secure this guy if we are going down?  Should I just leave him there and answer the phone? I need to know what the captain is saying..\" meanwhile the wife is trying to wake him up and I'm asking my coworker to get medical equipment. I immediately switch to first responder mode once I see him turn pasty white. None of these passengers know about our engine problem and only a few notice this guy passed out in the aisle. I saw him fall so I was the \"caretaker\". The \"runner\" calls for any Medical personelle onboard and tells me that she can't call the captain because he's still talking to the \"lead\" (oh right we have that going on too). By the time a paramedic comes the guy is waking up but says his chest is really tight. He coughing and looks almost gray. We hook him up to oxygen and get him back to his seat. The Paramedic says we need to land soon (haha) and get him to a hospital. As we get him back to his seat I notice the lead flight attendant has a yellow life vest on and is coming towards me. Oh crap. Oh crap. Oh crap. She tells me that the captain was able to turn the engine back on and that we should be landing in about an hour. We send up the message about the sick passenger. I know most passengers had no idea about any of this. I was standing there in the back galley, sweating from helping this guy back to his seat, stressing about the poor new hire who we locked in the bathroom and just trying to gather myself. A passenger slowly walks up to me, stretching, yawning, pulls his ear buds out and asks, how much longer? Are you guys going to come out soon with the drink cart, can I have a sprite?

I was 7 months pregnant at the time. About 2 hours into the flight we hit turbulence. I\u2019ve never been a nervous flier, have gone on many long haul flights, and have never been one to be concerned by turbulence before. When this turbulence started I thought \u201cthis is rough\u201d, but wasn\u2019t too concerned. The fasten seatbelt lights came on, but the crew were midway down the aisle with the cart. They didn\u2019t seem too concerned to start with and were handling the turbulence with ease, when suddenly it felt like the plane got hit it jolted so hard. The FAs in the aisle fell onto the passengers next to them and my head bounced off the wall next to me. As the turbulence ramped up a notch an announcement came over instructing the crew to secure themselves immediately. The FAs immediately abandoned what they were doing and went and secured the cart and all the crew were quickly strapped into their seats. The turbulence was still going quite violently and I was having to brace my arms to stay steady. At this point I was already thinking this was the worst turbulence I\u2019d ever experienced, but I was expecting it to end soon like it normally does. I was very wrong... \n\nAfter what was probably a minute or two of this quite shocking turbulence I was thinking \u201cit won\u2019t be long before people start puking\u201d and I was right. Sick bags were rustling all over, sounds of vomiting filled the air, and calls lights started pinging rapidly. Obviously the crew didn\u2019t attend any. Of the two FAs I could see one had her head tipped back and eyes closed while gripping onto her seatbelt, the other was looking grimly out at the scenes unfolding before her. I was just starting to get queasy and thinking this was a total nightmare when suddenly the turbulence hit a level I didn\u2019t know even existed. It felt like we were in a washing machine. I had my seatbelt on, secured below my bump, and yet I was being thrown around like a rag doll. I have a condition where my joints dislocate very easily and I felt my wrists, elbows, and shoulders subluxing as I desperately tried to cling onto the arm rests to prevent my whole upper half being flung around. My legs kept smacking against the seat in front with each up and down motion and my head kept slamming against the wall with the side to side. My neck felt like it was going to snap. It was so violent I couldn\u2019t actually see what was going on around me, it was just a blur - it felt like being on a rollercoaster. It was just a total lack of control, wanting it desperately to stop but being at the total mercy of the elements. You could hear people gasping and maybe sobbing and lots of banging and rattling. Just as I was wondering if it was ever going to stop I suddenly shot upwards. We were plunging. The lights all went out and everyone screamed. It was ear splitting and haunting. I legitimately thought it was the end. My butt was off my seat, I was held down only by the belt across the top of my thighs. It was the weirdest feeling, like being sucked upwards.\n\nAs quick as it happened, it stopped. The lights flickered back on, and we were back to turbulence. It wasn\u2019t as bad as it had been at it\u2019s worst, more just moderate turbulence now. I turned and looked at my husband who was just white. I looked down to see his arm across my front, he\u2019d flung it across me and grabbed the other side arm rest to pin me in when we\u2019d dropped. He just whispered \u201cyou nearly went\u201d and all I could do was nod before blacking out (I have dodgy blood pressure issues to start with). \n\nI woke up to my husband supporting my head and the stranger next to him asking if I was ok or if I wanted one of her daughter\u2019s sick bags. The turbulence was almost completely gone, just the odd mild rumble that most people would consider normal. I looked around to see a few people all gathered and peering at someone up ahead of me, a woman who was still screaming at full volume. I think she was having some kind of anxiety attack. The FAs were now going up and down the aisle checking people. One stopped and asked if I was ok and I just said yes. I was really sore, everywhere hurt (I later found significant bruises all over my body), but I imagine that was the case for most people. I felt faint and queasy but otherwise fine. The rest of the flight went relatively smoothly, but everyone braced and went silent at the slightest grumble of turbulence. The seatbelt lights stayed on the whole flight and we were told only to get up if it was absolutely necessary. I had some contractions towards the end of the flight but they stopped once I got off the plane and walked so I think they came more from being sat in an uncomfortable position for 4 hours. After everyone had calmed down the captain did an announcement apologising for what happened. He did explain why it had occurred and it was something to do with a thunder storm but I didn\u2019t really absorb the details because my mind was reeling. He said the big drop was us actually plummeting over 100 feet in a single instance, but that it hadn\u2019t been a fault, it was actually a decision he\u2019d made to avoid something that would have been dangerous to fly through.

He freaked out. I operated 747s as a station manager for several airlines out of SFO and knew them well. I ordered him to go forward and up and shut down all non-essential buses and breakers and id go aft. We eventually got it to stop and after an hour we found where the fire started between 2 bulkheads From a short. I was sure I\u2019d die in the mountains of Afghanistan in the middle of a war.

Wine bottles, full cans of soda, and lots of hot trays went everywhere.\n\nWe were diving really quickly and steeply, people were screaming, and I couldn't find my other FA. The engines were running higher and louder than I'd ever heard and I screamed at the person closest to me to hold the cart down no matter what, and tried to make my way to the back galley, climbing uphill over bags from the overheads. I got to the galley and tried to get a hold of the flight deck, no answer. I call again and the line connects to alarms and buzzers \n\n\"Secure the cabin and sit the fuck down, fast.\" This is all I hear from the captain before he cuts the line.\n\nI look down the aisle towards the front of the plane, it's full of just about everything. I grab the med kit from the crew bin, and a portable oxygen tank and carefully make my way back down the cabin. We are still diving quite violently and I can see we're about to pass through the clouds, which doesn't tell me much (I've no clue how tall they are obviously) but clouds are near the ground (this sounds dumb but I'm not a cloud expert, I do what I can with the information I have) \n\nI climb over the cart, and in an empty aisle I find my other FA, I'll call her Jane, clutching her head and she's bleeding quite a bit. I get her up and in the closest seat and buckle her up. Someone shouts they're a doctor, and I motion them over and tell them to buckle up. As they're attending to Jane I look around for the nearest seriously injured person. Seeing none of urgent attention, I start shouting:\n\n\"Get your heads down! Tighten your seatbelt as tight as it will go! Get your heads down!\" And I make my way back to my seat. \n\nStrapped in, I call the flight deck and hang up, and repeat the process twice more, our Airline's way of signalling a secure cabin in an emergency. I look out the little window next to my seat and I can see the forest below coming up fast. I've never heard engines screaming so loudly, I've never heard metal groan, but I could feel it in my bones. The plane was moaning and groaning. It was otherworldly.\n\nI swear, at the last possible second we levelled out, the L A S T possible second. After a few minutes the captain called and told me that they had had major control failures and that we were landing immediately. \n\nLong story short, the turbulence was severe enough to damage our control surfaces, rendering our plane about as flight worthy as a rock, and I must say that the fact that the pilots got the plane under enough control to land was nothing short of a miracle. Best bit of flying I've ever seen in all my years in the air. \n\nJane was rushed to the hospital as the only severe injury and she ended up being okay, but never flew again. I still fly, although I'm a little more weary about whipping that cart out inflight."}, {"author": "dataslinger", "score": "9", "created": "11 hours", "comment": "As a passenger, was reading something while sitting in a plane on the ground at O\u2019Hare.

I had been on the route dozens of times, and I generally knew all the flight path variations. One trip I suddenly realized we had turned and were no where near my airport. I recognized the path, and when we turned again, I realized were in an unusual holding pattern. Turns out we had a serious malfunction, and we were literally burning fuel before we could land. We flew in a large holding pattern for over an hour, then the pilot announced we were heading home. Oh, and we would be met by fire trucks and emergency vehicles, but don\u2019t get too concerned (!!!!). I was an engineer for a large aerospace company, and I was spooked. We did the \u201cheads down\u201d thing, and the runway was lit up with emergency lights. Luckily we landed safely, and everything was fine. The pilots and flight attendant were professional to their core, but I had seen the flight attendant\u2019s eyes while she was on the phone, and she had been scared. I did have the contacts to find out what had happened, but I don\u2019t remember anymore. It was a control surface issue, but the details escape me. This was the scariest thing I have ever been in, probably because it was prolonged. I have also been in a wind shear downburst, but that happened so quickly that the fear didn\u2019t have time to settle in. The plane dropped abruptly, the pilot accelerated so fast that we were all pushed back in our seats, and then it was over.

There were about 4 or 5 other male passengers (I suppose we were the most \"able-bodied\").  She then gave us a spiel about what to do in case of an emergency landing that included the phrase \"If I'm unconscious, just open the emergency exit and push me down the slide.\"  She was pretty clearly in a state of panic, I had to ask if we should expect a water landing or ground landing, she was sweating, talking very erratically, etc.  Once she had the people from the bulkhead return to their seats, the flight attendants came out and gave a safety briefing to everyone on the flight, basically they just said to brace for impact make an X with your arms on the seat in front of you and place your head in the center.  After that we continued to fly over Lake Michigan either burning or dumping fuel (I never got the full story) for about fifteen minutes until the pilot came on the intercom to announce that the problem was cleared up and we'd be landing shortly.\n\nWhat ended up happening was the hydraulics had gone out, the landing gear wouldn't go down but they must have had some redundant systems in place/emergency protocol that managed to get it functional.  When we landed a few minutes later there were still half a dozen or so fire trucks near the runway, and a couple of firefighters even on the jet bridge.  Long story short, seeing a panicked flight attendant is terrifying."}, {"author": "pmabz", "score": "19", "created": "13 hours", "comment": "Passenger.

We tried several different altitudes to try to find our way out but it just wasn't working and the performance of the aircraft was getting so bad that we were struggling to hold a shallow climb. When we decided to descend through all of it to find a warmer altitude, the right propeller picked up some ice that generated a really violent vibration. It was the first time I had experienced that so i was mortified but still kept my wits and continued to fly the airplane when we were issued some information that required me to touch one of the metal guages that had an electrical short that could have been made worse by the friction of the ice, but it was one of the worst electrocutions ive had.
