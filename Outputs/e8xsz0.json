The patient coded right as I got on shift and died within the hour, so I wasnt especially tired. He came in as a doe, most likely homeless, so there was no family in the room. I was the nurse so I was sitting close by, didnt see anyone else go in there nor would anyone have a reason to except me  the morgue hadn't arrived yet cuz post-mortem care was not done. He was staying in the room known to ALL the nurses on the unit as \"haunted\" because the call light would go off or the bed alarm would go off frequently when it was empty. Out of the periphery of my vision I cant be sure but it did not look like he was wearing a gown, it looked like he had on street clothes.

Stuff I precognize are usually related to important events in my life, but mostly I can only realize this when they happen. A rare example where I tried to be careful, which was a little obvious compared to other ones: I dreamt about injuring my ankle in various different ways, traffic accident, fall, misstep etc. After 4 dreams/flashbacks etc. at the end of the month, I actually injured my ankle badly, while just simply walking in a lecture break. (Also my precognitions come in couple of ways, dreams/flashbacks/vague images flaring in before my eyes etc.)\n\n2- Some vivid dreams I keep having that are in amazing visual quality. Like I haven't seen objects like tat or wouldn't be able to design them if I was a visual engineer/designer. They're also strong when it comes to other senses. Also sometimes I feel very strange in my dreams but when I wake up and ask people who slept around me about what I saw, I usually get most details matching with their lives. Last happened with my current roommate. Also most of these dreams were actually nightmares back in my childhood. Somehow they've changed to not scary stuff mostly. Even if I see nightmares now, at least they're more realistic rather than demonic and high quality like that ones I saw back then.\n\n3- Sometimes, specifically while seeing some patients, I get to guess their names/some other personal details etc. before they tell me/hand me their id card. Not talking about stuff like guessing their problem based on symptoms, in a quick glance. Or guessing dice outcomes in games. Guessing measurable things on the dot, like time with minute right when it turns :59 to :00.\n\n**Sorry if my answer didn't fit the question as in I haven't talked about a single phenomenon I witnessed, but these are the spooky stuff happening to me that made me believe in supernatural stuff/metaphysics to some degree**"}, {"author": "AwakeAtNightTime", "score": "192", "created": "16 hours", "comment": "I was sleeping in my living room that had a clear view of the kitchen.

On my grandpa's last day, he said he would come back as a white butterfly. He knew exactly when he was going to die, he may have been somewhat psychic... A few days before; his doctor told him he would pass away in 2-3 days, but he corrected him saying he would die in 5 days (exact)... and he did just that.\n\n((The following is what my grandma told me))  I was about 5 or 6 around the time, the rest of my family and I were quite devastated when he died. But as we were leaving the hospital, the most interesting thing happened in front of my grandma's eyes.\n\nApparently little 5-6 year old me was surrounded by white butterflies, being the giggly child I was- I was laughing at all the butterflies around me. Just as my grandpa said before dying, he'd come back as a white butterfly. So this was confirming our belief that people come back as something else after death. My grandma said that the butterflies just disappeared into thin air before her and my aunt's eyes. (Yes my aunt saw it all too, they both recently talked about it) I'm almost 17 now and so many things are increasing my beliefs in the supernatural.

We had one of those bug zapper lights, the blue ones.  It had been going crazy with buzzes, like it was buzzing constantly.  No big deal, not usually.  Bugs love that stuff, they're stupid.  I had stayed up late because I was doing something super nerdy that won't get into, and had looked out my screen window to see this enormous spider, like the size of my hand, the regular size of a tarantula, maybe.  I had never seen one before and got to be uneasy.  So I went to the porch to see what all the fuss was about, and I opened the door to hundreds of bugs, MASSIVE bugs covering the porch, the light, the walls to of the house.  All shapes and sizes, I've never seen so many.  And bugs kept zapping themselves on the light, giant moths whose flapping wings made them look like flames the size of my fist.  The noise was this unforgettable skittering sound, like thousands of those spiders in Minecraft, but nothing was moving except those bugs zapping themselves to death. \n\nThere was nothing I could do.  They didn't seem to know I was there, and I didn't want to know what would happen if they did.  I closed the door and went to bed.  Going to sleep was easy, I think my brain was overloaded with what it saw.  I knew I could deal with it in the morning, tell my mom, whatever.  But the next morning, there was no evidence that anything was there, and every night after never got that festive.  No one said anything about it, and I never brought it up to them.  And I never saw a giant spider ever again or anything like it ever again.\n\nI've heard sometimes that you can transport to a different place and time on earth, to a world that's both alien and surreal.
