Like, not funny. Anyways, the quiet guy was me. Basically after I started high school (\\~3 years ago) family has gotten real argumentative - people always yelling over computer usage, gaming too much, not doing work, etc, etc. Being the middle child I either a) stay out of it or b) try to calm people down, be the level headed one, alleviate the mood, stuff like that. I mean there\u2019s so much turmoil around me, why add to it and cause more issues? Internalizing all of it doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue\u2026 \n\nSome time last summer I decided to just take myself of parental controls, reset the admin password all that stuff. My parents and sister started going after me about how me getting of parental controls would worsen my SAT score, mess up shit, blah blah, I\u2019m gonna fail, you\u2019re gonna be homeless, whatever, so on. Internalize and carry on, don\u2019t add to the mess. I did threaten suicide once. Never mind that.\n\nWell one day my sister grabbed my computer and re-restricted it. I opened my computer. I tried to open my favorite browser. I saw a not allowed notice double-pop. And then she walked over and was like \u201cyyou know\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd I just blew up. Like I was pretty sure I was raging and screaming, but I don\u2019t remember my words. I chucked my beautiful several grand MacBook on the ground, and when my dad walked over to control the ruckus I just charged him head on. You ever been so mad your vision just blurs at the edges? It was like that. I\u2019m a super nerdy guy, love programing all that stuff and my computer is my life, but when I saw my computer with a shattered screen and loose screws on the floor I felt nothing.

He wasn't quiet, the exact opposite actually; loud, rambunctious and always finds the best in things. We were in band together and for the first three years of high school I never once saw him get mad. The few times things got to a point where most people would get angry he managed to calm everyone down. \nThen one day our senior year this freshman was being an obnoxious brat. Everyone hated him, he was rude, mean and just awful. We were walking in from band practice and he was behind us, apparently just shitting all over one of our friends. Saying just awful and cruel things to a guy who really didn't deserve it. I could see my bf getting frustrated. We'd been dealing with the shit all day and at this point I was the one soothing him, trying to calm him down. \nThen suddenly the kid said something. I didn't hear it but I saw my bf's face turn as red as a tomato. He whipped around and started screaming at the kid. I got between him and the kid as fast as I could, but our friends were stunned. I was legitimately afraid he was going to attack him and the stupid fucking kid just kept laying it on thick. All \"oh you pussy, letting your b control you, I could beat you any time of the day\". \nMy bf was twice his size, I have no idea where the kid got the confidence but thankfully my friends managed to drag the kid away before things got worse.

Anyways the picking continued throughout classes 1-5 (6year classes) and I didn't really care about bullies that much untill one of them decided that something needs to happen to me because I told them to f* off when they asked me to give them money that I got for my lunch.\nSame day when I was playing on the playground with my friends they pulled me out of it and beat me up (3 on 1 so there was no chance at defence) of course as I said the school didn't care so I went for a police report.\nBullies said that I was teasing them (which of course I didn't do) and proceeded to lie about what really happened there. I couldn't do anything about it because 3 people said the same thing and I was just one. (Friends were on the playground still and didn't follow me because they were scared). Situation was brushed under the carpet and then after some time I moved to another school to start off with clean card.\n \nChapter 2- Middle school\nAfter moving to another school I quickly noticed that my class was really sporty like REALLY REALLY sporty- it looked like they went to a gym everyday of their life.\nI didn't really fit into this class, I made 3 friends in there and we were all bullied on everyday basis because we were standing out. One of my friends was a girl that was back then a girlfriend of one of the buffed guys- he quickly noticed that I talk to her and tried to cut me off by threats. I didn't give up though because I liked her a lot and we got on well- I listened to her problems while she listened to mine I spent best time with her back then. After some time she told me she hates the guy that she goes out with (the one that threatened me) so I told her that she should take a break from him.\nThis was not a smart idea of me.\nBullied started a day later and it wasn't so plain and simple as it used to be. \nI was threatened with knives, slapped by nearly whole class (including girls), spat on, experienced psychical abuse, beaten and even thrown and locked in our changing room for 3 hours.\nThis would continue untill 3rd class when I was publicly humiliated by them in the middle of our town. Then I said it needs to stop- I snapped.\nNext day I was so furious that I went to the guy that started the whole nuisance and tried to beat him up- I started throwing punches at him- tried to punch him in the kidney or head but it was no use. I was beaten up by him and taken to the hospital. \n\nChapter 3- high school \nEverything is normal now I got loads of friends in my class and I have not experienced any bulling for now, I hope it will stay like that untill studies.\n\nConclusion:\n Sometimes even If you snap it won't end any of your problems, you are not a hero in this world, you can't win against some people.
