//Used to resize the images in temp.
//If a comment is not long at all (say 30 chars), the image size is still 1920x1080 or something big like that.
//This program is meant to resize those images to more acceptable sizes. 1920x1080 --> 600x400 or something like that
//This will make it easier to read while making the larger comments unaffected.
