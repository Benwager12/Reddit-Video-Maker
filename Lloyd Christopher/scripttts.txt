If Willy Wonka made cheesecakes instead of chocolate, how would the story of “Charlie and the Cheesecake Factory” be different?

It is terrifying how lonely middle age is. I can absolutely understand why so many middle-aged men commit suicide. I'm actually trying hard to get out and meet people, but it's difficult. I'm an outgoing guy, and it is hard to form friendships with other guys. Then I imagine how all the socially awkward men just don't even bother any more..

Being expected to make the first move always gets me super anxious. I hate the idea of misreading a situation, or making a woman uncomfortable, so I tend to "disregard" a lot of obvious hints when I first start seeing someone..

When I was a teenage boy, my sister fell into a river. My dad put his hand on my back and pushed me in after her, saying "go get her". Her leg was stuck on something but I got it free and she swam back to shore. I, however, was pinned by branches under the water that had somehow gotten around me (there was a whole tree under the surface). I remember looking up to the water's surface and seeing the silhouettes of my family members walk away from the edge and thinking "no! wait!". Long story short, my fight-or-flight system kicked in and I scrambled as hard as I could to free myself and eventually got free and came up to take the best breath ever. When I was crawling back on the sand, my dad, sister and brother were about 100 yards down the bank. He turned and said, "c'mon!" and I hurried after while gagging on water. That about sums up my experience so far. People just expect you to be "okay" in obviously dangerous situations. I knew guys who drank themselves to death because liquor is easy but saying "I need help" is hard..

My last relationship I got cheated on. She (my ex) spread rumours that I was abusive and violent, to hide the fact she's an unloyal person. 

I had to find out through her best friend messaging me asking me if it was true, because I seemed like "the nicest person", and she wanted to know the truth. I explained and she was shocked. I was shocked. I didn't think she'd stoop lower than she had done already. 

I'm lucky no one took her serious enough to contact the authorities..

I am pretty young, but somehow, this shit still happens. I was playing with my sisters at the park, and we were playing tag. At one point, this middle aged lady comes up to my sisters and asks if they know me, and how they know me and whatever. I come up to her and say, those are my sisters, and she just gives me the stink eye, ignores me, and turns back to my sisters and keeps interrogating them. It was only after my mom came to see what was going on, that the lady left. BTW, I'm in middle school, and have been mistaken for being 11 years old, so I don't know what that lady thought I was doing.

Edit: I did not know this would get a lot of points. I do live in America, and unfortunately, the Karens run wild here..

Being told to "Man up" when you're having a terrible day..

You could be the most depressed person on the planet and no one would give a shit. It’s something I’ve been thinking about recently and it’s making me even more depressed.

I don’t know if it is actually “scary” for me, but awkward and something I overthink. 

I am over 6’5”, can kind of come off as intimidating do to that alone, but am really just a teddy bear. At my job, I have to walk through a dark alley in a downtown area, to get to the parking lot. 

Lots of times, there are women walking back to go to their cars as well, and then my lumbering loner self is walking behind them. I feel awkward and scared they are going to think I am going to hurt them or am going to rob them or something. I’m just trying to get home! 

I follow farther behind, always act as inconspicuous as possible, which probably makes me more suspicious, get on my phone like I am texting or act like I am calling someone so they can here I am far behind them and not stalking up on them. 

Maybe it’s just my social awkwardness or the fact there is a lot of crime that happens in our town, but I don’t want to be seen as a threat by people I would never hurt..

I'm 29 and don't have a girlfriend. My fear isn't so much not finding someone (there's always time for that), my fear is meeting someone I think is the right person, having kids and it doesn't turn out to be the case.

Edit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up like it did. Thanks for all the upvotes and thank you to all the men who shared their similar fears and experiences. As men I think we need to talk more about the wounds people don't see...instead of holding it in.

We're often so busy with our own stresses and commitments we lose sight of the fact that the guy sitting next to us has his own problems, fears etc.

And to the people who complained because this "isn't a male only problem"...stop being so serious. It's a legit fear many men feel and don't talk about, which is how I interpreted the question.

Cheers.

You're pretty much on your own. 

Less of your problems are taken seriously, you're seen as weak if you can't sort them out. You're expected to throw yourself in harm's way at a moments notice.

The courts look at you less favourably, so does a large portion of society. You're seen as a potential rapist and child molester. I love kids but God forbid I smile at one in public.

You're the one who has to be able to sort everything out, even if you sometimes feel like just curling up in a ball and crying..

How we’re pretty much left to ourselves in the case of rape/domestic violence or abuse..

Being told that because you're a man you aren't allowed to succumb to your chronic lower back pain. That you're less of a man because you have some days where you have trouble walking or even getting out of bed because it hurts to even breathe.

Edit: to everyone who has commented with their stories so far and the more (I'm sure) to come, thank you all. I truly appreciate the support I've gotten for my own situation as well as being able to see what others are going through and that it doesn't have to be gone through alone. I thank you all and I'm sorry, I more than likely won't be able to respond to everyone but I will do my damnedest to at least read all I can. Please know that if anyone wants to play a game online with me to forget the pain or just to do something other than hurt I will be happy to try and find something to join you on, if that's something you're interested in or want to do..

Your whole identity is wrapped up in your job. You weren't born to be a doctor, lawyer or entrepreneur? You must be some kind of loser. 

Your industry is laying people off? You're definitely a loser. Your fault for choosing the wrong major twenty years ago..

Speaking on behalf of my husband: the sheer expectation that he can shoulder everyone’s stress. If you are a man with emotional intelligence, people will simultaneously act like you are both a rare unicorn, and that you must take that emotional intelligence and merge it with the “MEN CAN SHOULDER IT ALL” mentality. 

This means he’s utilized way too often by too many family and friends who don’t make any emotional effort. He’s asked to manage everyone’s drama. 

He doesn’t, but the sheer expectation that he won’t burn out simply because he’s a man is hard to watch..

This one's a lot less serious than the other answers but having to be the one to make the first move with a girl is utterly terrifying. I asked the girl I've been crushing on for her number a few days ago and even though it worked out, I felt like I was about to throw up from all the nerves..

Being in an abusive relationship and sexually harassed and not having people take you seriously about itm.

expectations to “be a man”.

The loneliness of it. I've got a small but very close-knit group of friends and family, but even still I sometimes wonder why I'm so unlovable because I'm still single. People tell women all they time they don't need no man, but for guys if you're single you're seen as a creep, weirdo or defective in some way..

Expressing feelings. I’m still a human. I should be able to express my feelings without seeming “weak”..

The first time one of your balls ascends into your groin.

No assumed support network. Too many men become isolated and lonely because they cannot share their emotions with their friends. Government services will also put you right to the bottom of every list so don't become homeless..

Losing your penis in an industrial accident..

That in some circumstances, you can be blamed of inappropriate behaviour even if you didn't intend for it, and still not be able to justify it.

That sometimes you're expected to make the first move or show dominance, like when proposing, or leading a group to do something.

That you can get a boner at any second, and if someone sees it, it either becomes a joke or an embarrassment.

And if you get hit down there, then you know what happens, excruciating pain plus a danger of becoming impotent or related complications.

Edit: am I dumb if I looked at that award and thought it was a chicken eating chicken wings, and later realised it's santa's hand, thanks btw..

Fear of failing the people who are depending on you..

Prostate cancer.
