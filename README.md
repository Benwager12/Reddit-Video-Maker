# Reddit Video Maker
This is a project that me and Lloyd have been working on in order to use ffmpeg to create videos that can read from Reddit. This project is a work in progress and can be unstable if there is no internet, access to Reddit has been blocked or an antivirus software blocked writing to a directory.

## Instructions
The instructions are particularly easy but different for either person's program that you would like to start.
* Ben's: Use the "scraper.py" to install questions from the recent Reddit posts, then pick one (or many) that you would like to use and press open "offline-video.py" to create this video.
* Lloyd's Use the main.py to start the generation process, you must agree to the terms stated and to indicate approval. If all required item are installed correctly, the script should do everything by itself. The script will show programs like Chrome/Opera web browsers and will show things like balcon which generates the voice wav file, but it should take less than 1 minute.

## Required Modules
* Pillow
* Requests
* Selenium
* Shutil

## Installed Items
* Python 3.6+
* Opera or Chrome web browser
* Daniel voice API
