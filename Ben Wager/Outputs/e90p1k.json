We know this for they took control of every facet that made up our society; and within their grip they subjected us to every cruelty imaginable: starvation, disease, war... Why they tormented our species to such extremes, we do not know, but what we do know is that the loss of human life during their reign was immeasurable. This unending nightmare culminated just over a millenia ago, when the Demons brought one unfathomable disaster after another to what little remained of humankind. It is said the Demons had no control over these cataclysmic events, and simply let them spread across the land, leaving nothing but ash and smoldering remains in their wake. The Demons wanted this. They grew weary of the First World, so it was only inevitable that they too would grow weary of Mars- *time to move on*, they selfishly thought, *you should've stopped us when you had the chance.* But how could we? Their rule was absolute, their armies seemingly infinite, and their will... Eternal. We were but ants to them. And then, when we thought all was lost, that we would return to the dust from which we were formed, *he* appeared. A lone figure, clad in emerald armor, armed with just his boomstick, looked towards the chaos which enveloped our lands and uttered only but one word: *\"No.\"*\n\nAnd with that sole utterance, our savior, The Great Defier, The One Who Stood Against the Infinite, began his one-man war against all that was evil. The Demons at first laughed at this supposed act of insolence. *He is but one man. Does this petulant fool think his tantrum will change anything? In time, he will know his place.* Then the great fortress of Phobos fell. The Demons still laughed, albeit, in a more strained manner. *Does he think violence will change anything? If he knew any better, he'd stop right now. Or does he not care for those he loves?* Those the Savior loved were long gone, taken from him by their wicked hands, and used in a display of excessive violence to keep others in line. Remembering this, the Savior launched into an even greater, deadlier rage, harnessing the sorrow within to fuel his rampage on Deimos... And so too did their great and mighty fortress on Deimos fall. The Demons were no longer laughing. They were growing fearful. Concessions were made, but they were not enough, for the firestorms of Mars still raged and innocents still bled. *If you get rid of us, you will damn your species to an eternity of strife and ruin. You need us. Without us, there is only chaos.* Their threats were met only with molten lead and silent, unrelenting rage. This rage continued right until the crusade's very end, when the Savior reached the heart of the Demons' infernal kingdom. It was here that the greatest of battles took place: one righteous soul versus the unending tides of Hell itself. Some say the battle lasted over a century, while others say it ended in mere minutes, for the Savior's rage was too great for even Hell to contain. Such a matter of conjecture is unimportant; what is important however, was that the Demons were no more- their 'infinite' army vanquished, their leaders slain, and their unholy kingdom thoroughly destroyed. It was not long after that peace returned to Mars. Seeing this, the Savior knew his work was done. \n\nNo one truly knows what happened to the Savior after Hell had fallen. Some say he returned to the grasslands of Mars to live the rest of his days in peace, others say he still remains in Hell, remaining ever vigilant in case the Demons were ever to return. There are even some fools who say *he became the Demons*. No one knows for certain, but we know this: humanity is eternally indebted to this man, this lone and enigmatic figure, The Great Defier, The One Who Stood Against the Infinite...
