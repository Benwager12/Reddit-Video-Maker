If I'd managed to hurt myself while saving orphans from a burning ice cream shop or something equally heroic, I might be able to wave at people with pride. As it stands, though, my scars are the result of an undeniably stupid attempt at ridiculous science.\n\nSee, I'd heard this rumor that Splenda (the artificial sweetener) would burn with a purple flame upon being ignited. Being the brash twenty-something that I was, I decided that I was an *adult*, and therefore free to conduct ill-advised chemistry experiments in the confines of my tiny apartment. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that Splenda on its own did not seem to be particularly combustible... so I mixed it with a generous amount of rubbing alcohol, dumped the resulting mess onto a ceramic plate, and set the whole thing ablaze.\n\nAll of this, incidentally, took place atop a wooden desk in a carpeted room.\n\nAs could probably be expected, things got out of control pretty fast. I soon realized that I couldn't extinguish the flames via conventional means (like blowing on it really hard). Furthermore, I didn't have anything with which I could smother the conflagration... so my only option was to carefully pick up the plate and carry it to the kitchen sink. Despite my slow, measured steps, I still managed to stumble, splashing the back of my hand with liquid fire in the process. It hurt like *hell*, but I knew that if I flailed around at all, I'd likely set the entire apartment alight.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity (but was probably only about ten seconds), I finally made it to the sink. I dumped the plate, howled in pain, and asked my girlfriend to drive me to the hospital.\n\nWorst of all, I didn't even notice if the flames were purple or not.\n\n**TL;DR: A burning curiosity and an idiotic experiment.**"}, {"id": "fdkbp2f", "author": "idolomorpha", "score": "219", "created": "20 hours", "comment": "Labor contractions.

Mine did, because of the block in the duct.\n\nI remember eating lunch (I was a teacher) and feeling even gassier as usual.

We were visiting San Diego from Barcelona. It was so bad I immediately got into the car, punched Hospital into the GPS, and drove to the nearest one, in Coronado. The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced, worse than a broken rib, and I was driving like a crazy person because I so desperately wanted it to stop. Went into the empty ER, the nurse asked if I had insurance, I did not (our national health service reimburses for costs out of the country but I had to pay first). She physically wanted to see a credit card before I could see a doctor. Went in to see the doctor, he put a flashlight up to my ear and said yup it's infected, here's a prescription for antibiotics and then handed me a single Tylenol with codeine for the pain. I mentioned we were flying to Seattle later that day and asked if it was safe to do. He said it was safe but he probably wouldn't do it if it were him. Stopped on my way out not ten minutes later, they charged $600 for the visit on the card, I took the pill and went home. The pain subsided a bit but was still so bad I couldn't sleep or eat or really do anything. FYI, this is not the worst amount of physical pain part of the story.\n\nWe had family and friends coming in from all over the world to meet us in Seattle so really couldn't see canceling. I'd been taking my antibiotics and ibuprofen, and about 4PM we got on an Alaska Airilnes flight to Seattle. Taking off and the climb were pretty much no change, once in the air my ear popped and I felt a bit of relief. Silly ol' me thought maybe that meant  this searing pain in my ear was getting better. \n\nIt didn't. \n\nAs we started our descent, the pain came back. And then it got worse. Much worse. It was so bad I cannot think of an analogy for how bad it was. By the time the seatbelt sign had come on I was crying. My husband was hysterical. The flight attendants started freaking out because they didn't know what was wrong. As we continued descending it got worse and worse. I let out what had to have been a terrifying roar/scream for the entire plane. Flight attendants called for a doctor and luckily there was one a couple of rows behind. He figured out right away what was up, but didn't have any instruments and we were about to land so he switched seats with my husband and basically put his hand on my shoulder, and kept reassuring me that it would be over soon and I wasn't going to have any permanent damage. I was still crying like a baby and shivering and pawing at my ear like a crazy person when we landed. Doctor walked me off the plane, sat with me for a little while in the terminal, and said we can call for EMS but there really wasn't much they could do that wouldn't risk deafening me. He told me to take a huge dose of ibuprofen and said I could take an extra dose of the antibiotics and wished me luck. \n\nSomehow we made it to the hotel. I don't remember the ride, or the checkin, or anything else. I just laid on the sofa not moving, praying it would stop. About six hours later, I heard a high-pitched squeal in that ear. It lasted for...I dunno, maybe 15 or 20 seconds, and then a loud slurping noise as my Eustachian tube opened enough to equalize the pressure and the pain magically subsided. It may have been the happiest moment of my life. We flew back to San Diego three days later with no pain. I still grateful to that doctor who calmed me down and supported me. \n\nThe punchline to the story is that about three years ago a letter addressed to me arrived at my mom's house in the US. It was from a collection agency for $232. The hospital had forgotten to bill me for the Tylenol."}, {"id": "fdkg6yq", "author": "cain62", "score": "11", "created": "19 hours", "comment": "Wisdom teeth extraction.
