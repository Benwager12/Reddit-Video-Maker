There's the sticky snow you can make snowmen and snowballs out of. When sticky snow falls and then the temperature drops really low it gets really hard and you can't do much with it.\n\nThen there's the powdery snow that blows around in the wind and is good for skiing and and snowboarding and sledding. It feels like you're walking on the moon when it's freshly fallen. Sometimes in the morning if you listen closely you can hear it blowing around and it sounds how glitter looks. \n\nA hard layer forms over powdery snow when the sun shines and melts the top layer and then it hardens over night. It's fun to walk on because it makes a crunchy sounds but it's still soft on the bottom. Depending on how much powdery snow is underneath you can put your whole legs under. \n\nThen there's slush. It usually happens on roads and parking lots and its like someone took a freezee/icee/slushee and dumped it everywhere. It forms puddles and is hard to drive in but fun to jump in with rain boots in the spring. \n\nSometimes in the middle of winter it will get above freezing and slush will form but then freeze during the night If it doesn't get plowed off the road before it freezes then ridges where tires were will freeze and that's also hard to drive on."}, {"id": "fdldis7", "author": "IseultDarcy", "score": "16.0k", "created": "14 hours", "comment": "Snow is a great  sound insulation . If you're in a village or a place with not much people but still sounds (a car far away, animals, river etc..) it suddenly feel very quiet and calm, almost too much. Like if the time was frozen.\n\nUntouched snow is beautifull and it  screeches while you walk on it but once it start to melt, when many people walked on it, it become dirty and muddy.\n\nIt's very light and fragile but when the snow become a bit old, it start to be very heavy and compact.\n\n(please feel free to correct my english, I'm working on it)"}, {"id": "fdl9s87", "author": "Cinema_King", "score": "1.1k", "created": "15 hours", "comment": "It's very peaceful and nice to look at as long as you don't have to drive in it or remove it."}, {"id": "fdlhgu6", "author": "Thorneto", "score": "5.4k", "created": "13 hours", "comment": "As a northern Canadian, the idea of never having seen snow is actually mind blowing to me.

The better perspective is when I was growing up. I lived out of town and my parents had property, so it was great! Some of us would go snowmobiling, some of us liked to snowshoe, and us kids always built snow forts. Plus, if you ever got a chance to get out into the woods it is so beautiful and peaceful. \n\nOne memory that always stands out is when I took a snowshoe hike when the moon was full. No need for a flashlight, it was just so bright out. And so quiet too. I hiked up to a hill from which I could look out over Lake Superior. It was an incredible experience.\n\nNow I live in the city. In short, it sucks. There\u2019s not much to do outside when the snow comes. It just gets in the way and screws up your commute. I usually slip and fall at least once per winter. Once the snow is cleared it\u2019s just pushed into dirty piles on the side of the road/all over the place."}, {"id": "fdla3sv", "author": "VelociGecko", "score": "867", "created": "14 hours", "comment": "It's coarse and rough...

I slipped and hit my hip one the frozen ground hard!  Why did we move here??  The air hurt my face.  The car doesn't want to start, and my socks are always wet.\n\nDay 40:  FUCKING WHITE SHIT!  EVERYWHERE!   I can't close my eyes without seeing it.  Threw out my back shoveling off the walkway to my car, only to realize it was Saturday and I don't have to go anywhere.  I think the cold is leeching away my sanity.  I fucking hate this place.   I don't understand people who willingly choose to live in a place where they have to spend 20 mins EVERY MORNING cleaning off their car in temperatures so cold my fingers and toes are screaming in pain. \n\nDay 55: Well, I am done.  I can't take it anymore.  2 FEET of snow fell last night.  24 fucking inches. Heavy. Wet. White Fucking Shit!  I put the house on the market and told the family to start packing.

I hate every bit of it.\n\nActivities: This is the only good thing about snow. I'm talking like sledding and jazz like that. Yes, you have to drive to get there, but while your out maybe in an empty park parking lot, doing donuts is really fun. Sledding is really fun, and I always try to go every year.\n\nStorms: Probably the worst part. Imagine you had work for 12 hours, you shoveled your driveway in the morning, but while you were at work, there was a massive blizzard. Now you are getting home to your driveway covered in snow. When you just want to go to bed, you have to shovel the driveway AGAIN just to get up.
