Sometimes their kids will want me to join in with whatever little game they're playing, or coloring, or whatever. Now, of course it feels silly to be running around playing make believe with a small child, and I'll feel a bit self conscious.\n\nBut interacting with a child on their level, not talking down to them, I think, is important. When I was a kid I always appreciated my parents' friends who'd do the same for me. They didn't patronize me or speak to me how people often speak to children. I didn't feel condescended to.\n\nIt's nice sometimes to get to goof off, have fun with the kid, and be \"cool uncle Chaz\".\n\nAdults often take themselves too seriously for that, and I really like the joy it seems to bring the kids when I shed my grownup ego for a bit and just play and let them have fun.\n\nEdit: Since in my following post I used my real name, I figured I might as well edit it into this post, too.\n\nSecond edit: Thanks for the gold and silver, kind strangers!"}, {"id": "fdktiyz", "author": "Ethanreink", "score": "3.2k", "created": "17 hours", "comment": "Play-Doh.
