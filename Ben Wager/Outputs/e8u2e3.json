That's a bizarre sentence for you"}, {"author": "KevinKn", "score": "3.6k", "created": "18 hours", "comment": "Coming up on the 9th anniversary of a shooting that took place at my high school when I was a senior. \n\nA student that had been suspended earlier in the day returned to the school with his dad's handgun, went into the office of the vice-principal that had suspended him and opened fire. He struck and killed the vice-principal and critically injured the head principal who was responding to the sound of gunfire. The student fled the school and took his own life in a parking lot not far from the campus.\n\nI was in class at the time and an announcement came over the intercom that we were in a Code Red (lockdown). Some students/teachers say they remember the announcement saying that it was **not a drill** but I'm not really certain if that was included or not. My class locked the door, turned off the lights, and huddled in a corner but I don't remember a feeling of fear or that the room was tense. We had had a couple of Code Yellows earlier in the year for small fights in the hallways and Code Yellow/Red drills weren't uncommon so the class felt more inconvenienced by the fact that we were just about to break for our lunch when the announcement was made than anything else. \n\nAs we sat for longer without any update, a realization definitely began to come over the class that something more serious had happened and we were all on our phones looking to get some idea of what was going on. This was before Twitter was super popular and there was a ton of confusion &amp; misinformation going around from texts that people were getting from other students in the building and from family/friends who were now watching the story develop on the news.\n\nWe eventually received word that the school was going to be taken out of the Code Red and students/faculty would be released room by room and escorted out of the building by an armed police officer. We waited what felt like hours (we'd missed lunch and the room was restless) and finally received the knock on our door to indicate we were leaving. The officer walked us out the back of the school and through a parking lot that led to a church that neighbored the school. I met up with my parents and went home to watch my school on the news.\n\nLater that evening I went to dinner with some friends to just spend time with one another and we got word while we were there that our vice-principal had passed from her injuries. We finished our meal in silence, paid our check, and went to the school for a candlelight vigil. There had to have been 400+ people with candles and homemade signs and people just took turns praying and speaking to the crowd. Nothing planned or officially organized, just an opportunity for people to hurt together.\n\nIt sounds cliche when people say \"I never thought it would happen here\" but that really is the only response that makes sense after something like that happens. I remember an intense sadness in the days that followed and cried more than I ever had before or since. When I think back about that day, I like to remember the kindness of the community at the candlelight vigil and the posters of support from neighboring schools that lined the main hallway of the building for the next month."}, {"author": "arbitrarion", "score": "8.7k", "created": "18 hours", "comment": "I was around for Elliot Roger's shooting at UCSB. There are a few things that I remember being surprising:\n\n1. The sense of humor. This was not everyone, but I remember a couple people making \"finger gun\" gestures at each other. I think this as because the event lasted a while and spread over the Isla Vista area, so there was a general discomfort wherever you were. I think people were coping with the stress however you could. Gallows humor, basically.\n2. The awkwardness of trying to console someone who just saw their friends shot or where shot at themselves. If you have ever been in a social situation where you didn't know what to say, add in the fact that whatever you say might permanently affect the life of the person you are talking to.\n3.

I was walking back to my apartment just off campus when the notification went out that there were reports of gunshots and to get inside because campus was locking down. I finished walking home and turned on the news with some friends. I had other friends who were hiding in classrooms. The craziest part was the amount of misinformation going around on social media and in various group messages I was a part of... There were reports of more people shot and multiple shooters in a coordinated attack around various parts of campus and such. I\u2019m not sure how much of that was fabricated maliciously and how much started with someone seeing a plain-clothes officer with a gun or something and the story snowballing from there. \n\nI called my mom afterward and she started crying.

I wasn't directly in the fire or anything, just a student in the dorms.\n\nIt was very surreal. That morning my friends and I sat in the dorms watching the news evolve on campus. It started off saying one or two injured -- at that point we didn't make too much of the situation. I remember the newscaster saying at one point that the new updates was over 20 fatalities(the final count was 32), and we all just froze. We assumed it was in error -- it was not.\n\nAs the day evolved we reached out to our friends to make sure they were okay, but cell service was very spotty. I had a very uneasy feeling that a somewhat peripheral friend of mine was in danger and tried to text her, it turns out she was shot(but survived). Another of our friends was shot and killed.\n\nThe next few days were strange. Classes were cancelled and many left the campus. President Bush came to speak to us, but I'm sure even he felt helpless with not much to contribute. Eventually, they cancelled the remainder of classes and exams for the semester and we left for the year.\n\nThe summer was difficult. At my summer job people kept trying to talk to me about the shooting, both coworkers and customers. I don't know why, but I felt okay discussing it with fellow VT students but nobody else, including my other friends and family. I eventually quit that job and got a new one, not telling anyone I was a VT student.\n\nReturning to school felt surreal. We did a lot of school spirit activities at football games(we are Virginia Tech, etc.) but it was definitely a different atmosphere. I felt very uncomfortable in lecture halls and whenever my mind went blank I imagined a shooter coming in and killing us. That feeling still persists sometimes -- in large groups I'll start thinking about a mass murder occurring.\n\nThat day, I'll always say, is the day I grew from a child to adult. I changed in ways both positive and negative. I made new bonds with my fellow classmates but felt isolated from some other people. It was definitely the defining experience of my young adulthood. For a long time, I didn't want to talk about these experiences with anyone. Now, I try and speak more openly about it because I am trying to advocate for a better future."}, {"author": "[deleted]", "score": "2.3k", "created": "18 hours", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"author": "scrunchieonmywrist", "score": "5.0k", "created": "15 hours", "comment": "I hope I\u2019m not too late to get buried here.

The kid got kicked off the speech and debate team and decided to get revenge on the teacher. He bought a shotgun and went into the school on Friday the 13th. He fired two shots right off my hallway and killed a girl (who died after being in a coma for a couple of weeks) then he went to the library, started a fire, and killed himself.\n\nI was in my science class right off the hallway. We were in the middle of a test and I (being the shit student I was) just wanted out. I was about to ask to go to the bathroom when I decided fuck it, I'll finish the test, then go home.\n\n5 minutes later there was a gunshot. The first thing that crossed my mind was that a janitor was removing one of those giant ass wooden doors and accidentally dropped it, slapping it against the ground. Students looked back and forth nervously. Then a second shot went off.\n\nMy teacher went out into the hallway, and a minute later returned to the room and told us to get into lockdown. I guess he saw the smoke in the stairwell and saw what happened in that hallway. \n\nBefore long we were all crammed into the corners behind the big lab tables. I was sitting in the middle of the classroom so I was one of the last kids to get to a spot, so I was basically sitting out in the middle of the room hiding behind a trashcan. The whole time my teacher (a massive slab of muscle) was upright right next to one of the two doors ready to fuck up anyone that might walk in.\n\nWe were in lockdown a good 3 minutes before the announcement even happened.\n\nWe sat there for what felt like hours before the fire alarm went off. I'm assuming this was the fire started in the library. \n\nThen even longer and we began hearing voices down the hallway. My teacher looked right to me, in the middle of the room, with a nervous look in his eyes. Finally, cops/swat showed up, they tried the door and my teacher jumped and looked at me again, who was giving a violent nod and a thumbs up.\n\nThey cleared the hallway before asking us to open the door. We all got pat down upon exiting, and sat out in the cold on the track field for a couple of hours before being bussed off to a local church.\n\nI remember texting my parents and sister that I loved them, and funnily enough I remember making jokes to my mom, cause I bet she was more scared than I was (which was pretty fucking scared).\n\nFor the rest of the month we had a long winter break. When we all got back things seemed really cool, everyone was closer to each other and supportive. As the year went on things went back to normal, the usual bullying and other shit, so I went to online school.\n\nAsk any questions you have.\n\nEdit: being in Colorado, where there was Columbine and Aurora. I now don't like going places with big crowds, especially protests or anything of the sort.\n\nAlso: before you click this link, do me a favor and DON'T remember the shooters name, don't look at his picture, don't give him that honor. He was troubled and I feel bad for him. https://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/14/arapahoe-high-school-shooting-gunman-intended-to-harm-many-at-school/\n\nEdit 2: I remember afterwards while we were waiting to be bussed off, everyone was speculating who it was. They were speculating this one kid I knew and got along with pretty well. He was a weird kid but lots of fun. I remember thinking it was shitty, all the sudden everyone wasn't surprised at might be him because of the way he was treated. After school was back on, everyone was suddenly nice to this kid. They knew it was because they didn't wanna be the next target.\n\nTo the High school kids that might be reading this: you know that one quiet awkward kid that sits in your class? Don't be nice to him because you're afraid of what he'll do if he snaps, be nice to him because we all need that in our life. After all, we're all stuck on this rock hurdling through space, so just be fucking pleasant to one another. Start a conversation, ask about hobbies, be a good person.\n\nEdit 3: think of a person right now, any person. Now send that person a text. \"How are you doing lately?\" Now listen to what they have to say and offer support.

All the sudden we heard a loud BANG noise, and everyone looked towards the door. At first we shrugged it off as the janitor dropping something in the hallway, but after the second and third bangs we were ushered into the corner and told to be very quiet while my teacher ran and locked the doors. We were confused but unbothered at first, but the longer it went on the more worried we became. The loudspeaker crackled on and we heard muffled voices and muffled bangs, then silence. Years later I was told it was our principal and the office staff trying to warn us, but were killed. By now were were all silently sobbing and holding hands. I remember being very scared but not entirely sure of what. Of course, a school shooting was not the first thing on our minds. Eventually my teacher told us to crawl across the floor and into a supply closet, where we sat terrified until SWAT and police officers opened the doors and helped us out. We went out one of the back doors and walked the drive to the firehouse, where our parents picked us up and took us home.\n\nThat experience has changed me forever and while the effects I had initially (nightmares, anxiety, etc) have lessened, I still feel them.

No shots were fired. But what happened disturbed me so much that I am now seeing a therapist to talk about it.\n\nBack in August, I started working as a substitute teacher in one of the worst school districts in the nation. It is severely underfunded and understaffed. Most of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunches due to poverty. Many come from broken homes where violence, drug addiction and criminal activity are part of everyday life.\n\nThis was one of the most challenging jobs I'e ever had. Most of the kids I worked with refused to even stay seated, let alone do any reading or writing. I was harassed relentlessly and regularly threatened with physical violence. It often felt more like I was working in a holding center than a middle school.\n\nLast month, I was completing a special education assignment at a notoriously bad middle school. None of the students were behaving, but there was one in particular who was wreaking havoc.\n\nIt was toward the end of the day, and his behavior was only getting worse. During the class period, he kicked over chairs, threw pencils at other students, called me a bitch, and tried to spit on me. Physically speaking, he was the smallest and weakest-looking kid in the class, but he had all the rage of a middle-aged man in prison.\n\nEventually the principal showed up about 30 minutes before the last bell rang. He dropped in because he heard all of the noise and commotion in the classroom.\n\nHis presence did nothing to diffuse the situation. In fact, it only made it worse. The student started tipping over desks, hurling safety scissors at the principal, and threatening to fight him. Much to my horror, the principal fired back, calling the student a \"baby\" and a \"weak guy.\" Despite the awful behavior, it seemed very unethical and unprofessional to mock this child in front of his peers. I could see that the child was actually fighting to hold back tears.\n\nBy now, a teacher aid had shown up and removed the other students from the classroom (there were only four of them, as it was a special education class). It was just me, the principal, and this violent, foul-mouthed, 12-year-old kid.\n\nI was curious to see how the principal would handle things.\n\nHe called the kid's dad and asked him to show up at the school. The phone was on speaker. The father was screaming at the son, calling him a \"little bitch\" and threatening to beat him when they got home. Obviously, it was clear that CPS would be getting involved.\n\nWhile we waited for the father to show up, a security guard entered the classroom to assist the principal. I was unable to physically restrain the rampaging child, as I am not licensed or trained.\n\nThe security guard insisted on searching the backpack of the student. This made the kid extremely nervous.

Most terrifying moment was hearing shooting on the floor I was on. I remember not being able to comprehend what was happening, the shock, and texting my parents I love them. Another moment was when swat was trying to enter our room, everyone thought it was the shooter so no body moved, they ended up knocking the window out and at that point I thought it was the shooter and I was about to be killed. The relief when I saw it was swat was insane. They searched everyone in JROTC shirts because the shooter was seen in one. When we were being escorted, I saw 2 bodies in puddles of blood and someones body covered in what seemed like a blanket outside of the building, who ended up being Coach Feis. We were escorted to the intersection near school. Almost everyone crying, those who werent crying were in shock, and people looking for friends. I remember Alex Schacter's Mom frantically asking if anybody had seen her son, who I literally just heard before that people saw him get shot. I didn't tell her what'd I heard because I didnt know if it was true and I would never want to break that news to someone. I was hoping he was alive and it was just a rumour but it later came out it was true.  Since my house was close by, 7 of my friends and I walked to my house since all the streets were closed down.

We all sat there crying and in tears watching the deaths go up and up, I couldn't believe what had happened, I still feel like Im in shock to this day. I cant comprehend 17 people were brutally murdered in my school, 6 I knew personally, were dead. The 1200 building, nicknamed freshman building because I think about 75% of classes were for freshman, was the one that the shooter decided to target. The thing is, I was a freshman at the time, now a junior, so my class was the hardest hit. I cant believe how terrible my luck was. My two brothers loved and graduated from that school, and that first year I attend, the school is shot up and the building that was targeted is primarily my class, thats why I knew many people that had died.

I called her maybe 10 times, frantically texting her and checking snapchat to try and see if I could see any updates. I called and texted my friends back home and at my high school, and I called my mom to break down crying. \n\nWhen I got the confirmation from a friend at my high school that her family just had to identify her body at the scene, I locked myself in my dorm room and cried for a solid hour. I had never cried so hard in my life. She was the kindest, most loving, and just amazing person I had ever known. When I was alone with no friends, she treated me like she had known me her whole life. \n\nWe had gotten especially close in our senior year as we sat next to each other in several classes and spent almost every day together during rehearsals for our school musical. I remember her love of dark chocolate and Hamilton, how she'd make musical references all the time and just brighten up anyone's day with her laugh alone. \n\nWhen I had to attend her funeral with my choir to sing, I saw her mother and believe me, nothing is more painful to see than a mother who's lost her child. She came up and hugged all of us, thanking us for being there and I had no idea what to say to her other than \"I'm sorry\", because what can you say to someone who lost their child to such cruel, random violence? \n\nTo this day, I get really bad anxiety in crowds and enclosed spaces. I'm afraid that I could end up like her one day. I've already had two school shooting threats at my university since then, but each time I was extremely lucky enough to be off campus when it happened. \n\nI know I wasn't directly involved in any of these situations, but I want this to show how much a mass shooting can indirectly effect the people in your life. Up until I lost my friend, I was like everyone else. You read or hear about these unspeakable cruelties, but it doesn't really occur to you how traumatizing it is until it effects you personally. \n\nMy heart goes out to each and every person affected by mass shootings and I just want you to know you are not alone. I mourn Alaina every day, and it's made me really appreciate the time I have with the people I care about. So please, hug your friends and family a little tighter, and don't ever take those you love for granted. \n\nYou never know when you might never see them again."}, {"author": "Kasplunk", "score": "27", "created": "16 hours", "comment": "Turned out to be a false alarm, but I was riding the bus on my way to campus when someone\u2019s text tone rang, just one.

Parents started calling and no one had any idea what was going on. The bus driver drove by the dorm where it was supposed to be happening, stopped for a second then kept going. We reached the campus side and he stopped again, apologized to us and said we all had to get off the bus. No one was allowed to stay onboard. As we got off everyone, total strangers, just kind of looked around and wished each other luck. I remember that distinctly. Good luck, random kid. Hope you make it, I guess. \n\nI remember walking to my building completely alone in an empty campus. A person here or there kind of scurrying through doors. I got in my building and hid in the classroom with everyone else and we locked the door and watched the news on the projector until everything was declared clear. \n\nThere was no shooter, there were no weapons. A bus driver had seen one of those samurai sword umbrellas on a student\u2019s back and called it in. Apparently the student was terrified and running from building to building thinking he was being followed. By 9:30am when my class got out, kids already had \u201cI survived the 2012 umbrella shooting\u201d shirts and wearing umbrella hats. I\u2019m grateful nothing happened and that\u2019s all it was, but it did sort of mess with me for a bit afterwards. That terrified walk to my building."}, {"author": "[deleted]", "score": "199", "created": "16 hours", "comment": "[removed]"}]}
