Since Abe was *incredibly* late in starting her geisha training (most geisha started in very early childhood and already debuted as professionals around the age of 14/15 back then), she was forced into prostitution and contracted syphilis, which is why she officially registered as a prostitute. She briefly worked as a waitress after escaping her brothel, but prostitutes were paid better so she eventually went back into prostitution after being tracked down. Fast forward a few years and Abe was working as an apprentice at a restaurant, where she became sexually involved with the owner. The two allegedly enjoyed a private dinner during which each of them rubbed food against their genitalia and fed it to the other. The guy was a womanizer, though, and Abe was very jealous. Shortly before murdering him, she held a knife to the base of his penis and said she \u201cshould cut it off so he couldn\u2019t play with other girls anymore.\u201d Later on, she strangled him and cut off his dick &amp; balls, which she kept in a small pouch.
