A confrontation ensued and the drunk trespasser had become aggressive and a fight ensued. Long story short the trespasser was given a proper shoe-in, so much so he's ended up in the street where he has then called the police. We attended and his injuries were substantial enough that the house occupant was arrested for Grevious bodily Harm (GBH) and it most definitely rubbed me up the wrong way in being involved in that job because I totally sympathised with the guy and felt any of us would've probably done the same thing if we were in his position."}, {"author": "TOWonthewire1", "score": "261", "created": "3 hours", "comment": "I'm not a cop anymore, but I rarely arrested for personal use marijuana. It's a harmless plant. Selling is a different story, because most of those dealers are supporting a cartel or a higher crime and I don't agree with that.\n\nThere was one case, where a bunch of guys in my agency would have arrested in a heartbeat, and honestly, by law I was required to investigate, but didn't.  A car drove through the back of someone's house because the driver confused the brake and gas pedal. The house that was driven through, had a lone marijuana plant in another room which is a felony in my state (and growers get SHIT on in my state). I stepped in front of it so the firefighters and others wouldn't notice and raise hell about it. This home owner was a good ole boy, and a church going father who worked a nice job and contributed greatly to society. I'm not trying to ruin his family's life over a plant. When I walked out of the house and came back in, the plant was missing, he was probably shitting bricks the whole time I stood there. Now that I'm not a cop, I thought about leaving a letter in his mailbox telling him I knew about the plant, but I don't want to make him paranoid lol."}, {"author": "MTVs_Dan_Cortese", "score": "175", "created": "3 hours", "comment": "Driving while impaired with resulting grevious injury or death.\n\nThere's a statute on the books where I works that prohibits ANY amount of schedule 1 drugs in your bloodstream while operating a vehicle.  Marijuana is still illegal here and is still classed as a schedule 1 drug (by state law).  If you are unaware, the byproducts of marijuana use can be detected in your blood WEEKS after your high has passed.\n\nThat means that you could legally smoke marijuana in any one of several nearby states where it is completely legal to do so, wait a few weeks, come to my shithole state, get crashed into while stopped at a red light with the other driver COMPLETELY at fault, pass the field sobriety test with flying colors, then get banged for our version of Driving while impaired with resulting grevious injury or death.\n\nI didn't actually know the marijuana provision of the per se DWI statute when I joined the county-wide crash team as an evaluator.  Someone told me a story about a guy they'd done who been completely faultless in an accident wherein two people had died and had admitted to smoking marijuana a few weeks earlier.  That'd formed the basis for a search warrant and he was convicted of the felony based on the bloodwork.  I started advising unimpaired, faultless drivers of the marijuana provision.  The attornies told me to stop, so I quit the team."}, {"author": "Col_Walter_Tits", "score": "312", "created": "3 hours", "comment": "Not a cop but my buddy is.

When I was in the Coast Guard, I did a lot of drug and migrant interdiction down in the Caribbean.

It was pretty heartbreaking having to send them back after seeing the state they were in, and the state of country they were trying to leave.

One guy tried to light himself on fire and others would try and injure themselves to try and get us to take them to US health care facilities.\n\nThe only redeeming thing about interdicting them was their ships were always very shoddily made and often times our act of interdicting them was also us saving them from a sinking ship."}, {"author": "VadaVade", "score": "89", "created": "3 hours", "comment": "I was working security for a low income housing facility.
