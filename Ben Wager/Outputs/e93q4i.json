The last time I had sleep paralysis was more than a decade ago. But I do remember this one experience. When I was little and sleeping alone in my room, I could open my eyes, but not move. My body would not listen to me. My eyes and my mind were wide awake though. It was really scary because I had no idea if I would stay permanently like that or not. I had to just close my eyes and try to go to sleep fully."}, {"author": "RadioDemonAlastor", "score": "62", "created": "9 hours", "comment": "I experience sleep paralysis occasionally and I usually see bugs on the walls that aren\u2019t there and hear noises, like doors opening"}, {"author": "FightOrFightMode", "score": "46", "created": "9 hours", "comment": "I didn\u2019t see anything.

The second time I tried to move myself by force but it felt like I couldn\u2019t summon enough energy to do it. Then I tried to move one arm or leg but like I said, it felt like there was nothing in me to move. I\u2019ve had this happen about five times over the course of my life, but nothing too recent. What usually happens is I go back to sleep and wake up normally and that usually solves it. It\u2019s quite a scary feeling the first time you get it.

The first time I randomly awoke in the bed with my wife. She was passed out next to me, n I was only able to look around with my eyes, everything else was paralyzed....I immediately felt a sense of dread and like I was being watched.... then I remember the door that was ajar opening a bit to my left... chaos..... struggling and trying to wake my wife..... then it was over and I could move, I got up and ran through the entire house checking for whatever it was.\n\nthen it continued for months until my wife left due to that n a few other things, I began drinking heavily and staying up all night until the sun came up. I then began to feel like I was being watched at home when I was alone...heard noises on the roof etc. I'd always check it out but nothing was there. It never happened in the daytime. I formulated a system to where it didn't happen until Christmas eve 2010. I was alone in my 4 bedroom out in the middle of cowfields and marsh, I decided \"Ya know what, fuck this shit I'm sleeping tonight.\" I went to sleep with my bedroom light on and the lamp on. I was still sitting up against my pillows when my eyes opened and I felt that same dread. I tried to move but was paralyzed...then the feeling of dread became overwhelming...like there was some kind of dark presence.\n\nThen as I struggled to try and regain control of my body, I saw something move in the hallway outside my door, then sure as shit an 8-9 ft tall greyish really skinny figure lurched through the threshold of my door. I became uncontrollable, primal even... my instinct was to scream and bite and kill out of fear. I  couldn't move. It walked over to my side of the bed and I was drooling on myself in a fearful rage trying to move and be able to bite this thing's throat out.\n\nI got to where I sat up right and was almost able to get control of my arms, and the thing placed it's hand over my face, my vision became blurry with tears. Then all I remember is sitting up covered in sweat, tears and saliva. I thought it was still in the house possibly.... so I slowly leaned over and grabbed my 12 gauge from under the bed and keys to an Isuzu pickup I had. Then for a few seconds that seemed like an hour I debated whether or not to shoot my bedroom window out and jump through it n just sprint to my truck.\n\nI decided against it, and just like MOUT training in the military stacked up on my bedroom threshold, took some deep breaths and as fast as I could cleared my hallway, then the living room, then the kitchen, and made it to my garage door. There was no light beyond that point..... I sucked it up, slung that fucking door open and jetted to my truck. I got the keys in, n the piece of shit didn't crank for 3 tries. Once it did, I peeled out and desperately tried to think of where I could go to be safe.\n\nI didn't realize it was Christmas Eve then, n there was nothing open, and no lights on anywhere in the whole county of 40,000 people. Then I remembered Wal-Mart... n sure enough the parking lot was lit up. So I parked there...tried to regain composure until the sun came up. N made my way to my mom's place. Didn't talk about it for a long time as I thought everyone would think I was insane. It never happened again. I got a tattoo to always remember it.

I was unable to move or scream for several minutes.  I dont remember much else, it was a long time ago.\n\nThe second time actually happened this year.  It was still dark out when I woke up and couldn't move, and at the end of my bed (you're gonna think this is a joke but I stg it is NOT) was what I could only describe as a demon pumping itself up like boxers do before a fight. I don't know if it was the paralysis wearing off or complete and utter terror, but I managed to throw my torso toward my end table, grabbed the lamp, and turned it on- thus evaporating my would be attacker.  I had a hard time in my bedroom for months, and I still get a spooky feeling if I'm alone in the dark in there.  \n\nOverall I'd say the experience is absolutely horrifying.

You know how there's some movies or shows that try to depict sleep paralysis and the character is still kinda moving and trying to jerk awake? It's not like that. There's literally no moving, no shaking or jerking. It's like your body is made of stone and the only motion you can feel is just your mind panicking. \nTo break out of it was a mind game. I would focus everything I had to one body part (usually my arm) and literally try to \"break\" out of it. So it was pretty common to see me go from perfectly still to \"throwing a punch.\" \nMy worst episode happened when I was sick and had a clogged nose. I woke up from my nap to paralysis and since I was sleeping on my side, my pillow closed my only partially open nostril. The other completely clogged. My mouth was closed and couldn't open it to breath due to the paralysis. (You literally can't move anything)\nI just slowly suffocated for only like 30 seconds all while panicking and crying in my head. \nI think after a certain point it was like my whole body just jumped and I started gasping for air. \n\nI never saw anything though other than the ceiling.

I remember the first few times it happened I was so irritated with my dad (I was probably 13-15 years old at the time) that he didn't come check on me after hearing me scream for what felt like forever until I confronted him one morning and he said he never heard anything. I started doing research on it because I lost the ability to sleep most nights and found out the more you understand what's going on the easier it is to come out of. You can't just go full blown panic. For me I have to try to wiggle my toes, then leg, then try to roll over and wake up. It also helps if you talk to yourself while it happening.. I often just tell my body to wake up, I repeat that I'm awake a few times, and remind myself that there isn't a demon on top of me it's just a miscommunication in the brain.

Its the ringing sound that felt like it truly got inside of my head, like if i let it go on for too long, my brain would explode.\n\nI read up on the internet that SP is mostly harmless and the shadowy figures are just an imagination, so you could just ignore it and go to sleep. But because of that ringing sensation in my head, i literally can't just ignore it, cant even force myself to sleep because i truly fear that my head was about to explode. You can't move and you can't scream, the only thing i could control was my eye, though it was very limited, so what i used to do is to force every muscle in my body to jolt myself into waking up. To prevent it from happening again, i usually put some music as i sleep to fill my head with thought (lyrics, melody, and such), because that emptiness in my brain seems like the trigger of the ringing sensation that i got when i experience SP.\n\nThough at one particular night of experiencing SP, i remember so vividly of seing a pair of shadowy legs across my room near the door, as i slept on my side. I can't move, so I close my eyes and 'force' myself to wake up. Feeling like i could move again, I opened my eyes, and i notice that the shadowy figures has gone.

At these times I\u2019m fully awake and in bed, my eyes are open and it just feels 100% real. I usually scream or thrash or try to throw my pillow at them, because in my head, these people are in my home in the night trying to hurt me, and it\u2019s real to me. There have been occasions where I wake up to one of them strangling me and I can feel the pressure of them on me and their hands around my throat.

The thing about sleep paralysis is that no matter what you see or even if you see anything at all, your brain is in panic mode, so some of these episodes you are genuinely *convinced* you're about to die.  Not just oh something scary is happening, your body is frozen and your brain is sending out every chemical it can to signal to you that you're about to fucking die.  The other thing that no one told me when before I experienced sleep paralysis for myself is that you can hallucinate other sensory input as well, it's not all just visual or auditory.  When I woke up to this witch standing over me after a couple seconds I realized she was grasping my wrist, tightly.  I could actually feel her hand around it.  So I'm lying there not able to move and literally convinced I'm about to die, with the little strength I have forcing out a meek \"No....please\" and I can hear her mumbling something under her breath that I can't make out, and then suddenly she's gone and I can move again.  And I suddenly realize the area that I was looking at that created this image of her was some white space on my wall between a dark curtain and the other wall that is more shadowed.  This is what baffles me the most about sleep paralysis, from my experiences it seems to be so different each time and I can't pin down what \"causes\" the hallucinations because sometimes my brain takes something existing in my room and just twists it into some creepy shit, and sometimes it creates something entirely new that isn't made from anything at all.\n\nThe good thing is it's not always completely terrifying.  I think the 5th or 6th big episode I had was the most interesting, because the moment I woke up and realized I couldn't move I immediately knew I was just having a sleep paralysis episode.  For a second I was okay, but then suddenly I feel this intense pressure behind my back (I'm laying on my side) and a sudden burst of extremely loud deep breathing right behind my ear, as if there is someone in my bed spooning up to me and breathing in my ear.  Naturally I'm fucking terrified, but I know it's not real and I've experienced that feeling of a ghost up against my back before.  Somehow I am able to muster up the ability to turn over onto my back after squirming a little bit, and as soon as I turn over onto my back I'm met with these...insane visuals.  The pressure and sound of whatever was in my bed is gone, and now I'm staring up at my ceiling at this morphing tapestry of these two floating men tied together in this weird way, where I can't really place where they're connected or how many limbs they have but I can see that one guy's head is facing away from me, up at the ceiling, and the other guy's head is sort of unfolding underneath his arm.  It feels like this thing is falling in hyper slow motion but as the guy on the right moves his head from under his arm he looks right at me and he's got this incredibly friendly face.  Like he was just this normal guy with a really warm smiling expression, short dirty blond hair, a bit of bear stubble, and he's just casually smiling at me as he floats in this weird chimera.  It's really hard to explain what it looked like.  But I distinctly remember as I'm staring up at this thing thinking to myself \"This is cool\" haha like I was still feeling slightly fear but I was able to recognize that fear as just part of the experience and I think the fact I was so familiar with this sensation by this point I was able to separate myself from the fear and just enjoy the visuals.  Then all of a sudden I snap out of it and I'm on my side again, which was bizarre.  Usually when you snap out of sleep paralysis you're still facing the same way, in the same position, because you were technically awake.  This time somehow it was like half sleep paralysis episode and half dream?  It all felt incredibly visceral, and everything from the ghost that was spooning me to the psychedelic visual all felt very real and very similar to previous experiences.  \n\nIt's all a very odd experience.  It kind of fucks with your relationship with sleep and also just your view of reality.  The fact our brains can just concoct these hyper realistic hallucinations that can even *feel* real really makes you think about what else is actually real.  I'm not saying I 100% subscribe to brain in a vat or the simulation theory or anything like that but it's just kind of eerie and yet also super fascinating.  As terrifying as that last experience was, I really overall enjoyed seeing that thing floating above me and it almost felt like a spiritual experience.  I have had issues with derealization and some small hallucinations in the past due to things I won't go into now, but my sleep paralysis experiences I feel oddly attached to not only because they're naturally a pretty personal experience but there's something I find so interesting about it when it happens.  Like it's still terrifying and I definitely wouldn't want it to happen every night, but every so often it can be a cool experience. I was never able to lucid dream, so this is kind of like the closest I can get to that and it's just really neat as a way to peek into your own subconscious or peel away at subjective reality a little bit.\n\ntl;dr - really scary but also kind of cool"}, {"author": "Guilty_Coconut", "score": "1", "created": "7 hours", "comment": "I woke up but couldn't move.

A shadow might look like the silhouette of a person, a crumpled up piece of clothing tends to look like something that has been grotesquely flattened. Back when I had a dog, my rumpled blanket would occasionally look like I had rolled over my dog in my sleep and cartoonishly flattened him like I was a steamroller or something. Hilarious to think about, but at the time you have sort of a reflexive panic reaction that is just a byproduct of which parts of your brain are active during sleep paralysis.\n\nAll in all, it's not really scary anymore. I know what it is, it's not like I totally lose my mental faculties. If I am unable to move, I know that it's sleep paralysis, and I know that whatever weird shit I'm seeing probably isn't there.\n\nThe \"paralysis\" portion is always uncomfortable, though, since I often times can't even do things like take a deep breath. I've found a pretty effective way to break the paralysis is to just hold my breath as long as I can while trying to wiggle my toes and fingers, though. I think the oxygen deprivation sets off a \"oh hey our body really needs to move\" signal somewhere.\n\nIt's spooky the first few times, after that it's no big deal. I'd rather have sleep paralysis than night terrors TBH.\n\nEDIT: Oh, it also tends to happen successively and when my sleep schedule is disrupted somehow. So if I wake up with sleep paralysis one night, I'll probably wake up with it again later that night if I try to go back to sleep.

I laid down, couldn't move and felt an enormous pressure lasting on my chest. Then I heard a really loud ringing noise and started to experience the typical feeling of impending doom. I tried moving my body and eyeballs really hard, since this has brought me out of a sleep paralysis before, and after quite some time - I woke up again. Atleast I thought so.\n\nThen I was laying in my bed again, able to think normally but as soon as I wanted to roll over on my side, I noticed that I'm still not able to move. Since I've never experienced 2 consecutive sleep paralysis before, it was really hard for (the young) me to distinguish between reality and dream. I felt extreme panic again and also heard a huge dog barking aggressivly besides my bed. By this point the panic started to fade, since I knew that there can't be a dog in my room and I woke up shortly after. Atleast I thought so again.\n\nI \"woke up\" completely confused and exhausted and walked over to my sister and mom still in our living room. I told them about my experiences and said that I'd prefer sleeping on the couch with the lights on. As soon as I laid down there, both my mother and sister just disappeared and the ringing noise and pressure came back. This time I also saw the typical shadow figure standing in our doorframe. This was the most disturbed I've ever felt because this time it felt too fucking real. I tried to inspect the figure but as soon as I shifted my attention towards him/her, I woke up in MY bed again.

I\u2019ll write some notable experiences that I had:\n\n-I have this happen quite a lot, but an intense feeling of pain like something is stabbing me with every breath I take. I know a lot of people feel like, suffocating but it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s legit like I\u2019m being stabbed or clawed at, it\u2019s super painful. A few times I\u2019ve felt breath on me when this was happening. \n\n-Demonic figures manifesting in my closet. It was one of my first sleep paralysis experience and to this day I cannot sleep with the closet door open. \n\n-You know Duskull from pokemon? I had something like that hover right in front of my face, like a skull with one glowing red orb/eye. Everytime I moved my eyes away from it, it would scream, so I was forced to stare at it until my sleep paralysis ended. \n\n-One time I woke up with my legs in a v shape. It felt like something started punching the gap between my legs. \n\n-This one was weird because it started as sleep paralysis but it ended up becoming a dream? Or maybe it was a dream to begin with, it\u2019s hard to tell because it FELT like sleep paralysis. Anyways, a figure was sitting at the edge of my bed and I felt an overwhelming sense of whatever this was, it was evil. It was able to speak with my telepathically, and we talked for a bit (don\u2019t remember what unfortunately) until I ended up falling into a dream. \n\n-I had a giant stuffed bear that used to be at the side of my bed. Hallucinated that it started moving and growling. \n\n-Saw a figure running around my room until it eventually started jumping on my bed\n\n-This happened a lot when I was younger, but I would feel like my whole bed was \nvibrating intensely. I heard it has something to do with astral projection, like the vibrations help you leave your body or whatever? Not sure I believe that, but one time I just went fuck it and decided to ride the vibrations to astral projection or whatever the fuck I read as a kid. I ended up hearing a shit ton of angry screaming voices so I stopped. \n\n-Sometimes I hallucinate my parents. It\u2019s such a normal thing to hallucinate (I currently live with them so it\u2019s nkthing out of the ordinary) but they always act out of character and cruel. My mind is so foggy though that I usually believe it\u2019s them and end up crying. \n\nBut the majority of the time, sleep paralysis is just an annoyance. All the above stuff I mentioned was REALLY rare cases (well, except for the stabbing one). Again, I\u2019ve been having it for most of my life so I had a lot of time for weird shit to happen. Mostly, it\u2019s just not being able to move until it wears off. I sleep with the tv on, so with commercials I\u2019m able to tell how long it lasts. The longest was around 15 minutes, when it\u2019s really long your body starts to ache from not being able to move. I think that\u2019s the worst part of it. But usually it\u2019s around a couple minutes, you feel EXTREMELY sleepy afterwards. If you fall asleep right after though, you\u2019ll probably have it again so I usually sit up and play on my phone for like 10 minutes to prevent it. It\u2019s pretty weird because I can actually TELL when about to have it, I think I usually have it when I\u2019m falling asleep because I\u2019ll have a sinking feeling in my stomach and be like oh shit here we go again.

I had a dream where I was being chased by some unknown creature through a forest.  I would wake up and still hear the sounds of crushing leaves and twigs while in my living room.
