The woman refuse to check and says well the computer says this so you pay this. My mom again, calmly states her case and implores her to check. \n\nWhat happened next? The girl not so indirectly accuses my mom of stealing it and sprinkles a little racism on top saying something about that is what she has seen most people \"like us\" do. Well my mom leans in and says through gritted teeth.... \"You listen here little girl...\" and what followed was such an eloquent display of filth and weaponized dialogue that what little bit of vile language I called myself using just a few days ago seemed foolishly inadequate and amateurish in comparison. \n\nAnd here I go, at the height of my mom's verbal battery of this woman, tugging at her arm. She tries to ignore me. I tug more. She tries to yank her arm away. I hold tighter and yank more. Finally my mom turns to me and says \"WHAT!?\" in a tone that most with common sense would interpret as \"Nevermind\" being the ONLY acceptable answer. But here I go, looking dead into her enraged eyes, straightening up my little body and said quite smugly. \n\n\"Momma, you said only ignorant people use curse words.\"\n\nI'll leave the rest to your imagination. But to give some hint at the cost of possibly dating myself (as if Blockbuster wasn't enough of a hint), this was when beating your child was 100% acceptable."}, {"id": "fdk46s4", "author": "LuluE9", "score": "238", "created": "21 hours", "comment": "I thought all commercials and shows were live.
