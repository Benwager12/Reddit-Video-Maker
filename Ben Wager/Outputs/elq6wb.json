To bring some clarity to the situation let me tell you. Pretending to be hurricane isn\u2019t hard. Especially when your 6. Sure it\u2019s hard to get into character and fully embody the destructive force that is a hurricane but in the end I think I nailed it. So let me start by saying that this is gonna sound ridiculous but it\u2019s all true. Let\u2019s go back in time to when I was six. I was staying over at friends house for a sleep over, and everyone knows six year olds are ridiculous. Upon waking up we we\u2019re playing with toys and stuff and someone had a nerf gun and tried to shoot another kid but he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t hit me, I\u2019m a tornado.\u201d And that\u2019s it, he had no acting classes obviously cause he didn\u2019t even try to portray it. Just said it like it was a fact and that we should take it to heart. But I knew he was a filthy fucking liar and not a tornado. So six year old me looks at said kid and something of the lines, \u201cthe only thing worse than a tornado is a hurricane.\u201d I spread my arms like a soaring eagle and begin to spin towards him. Fully taking in the destructive nature of a hurricane. Just Really living it ya know. Now I don\u2019t know if it was the spinning or if it was what I ate the night before. But my little hurricane tummy musta been ready for a poop I wasn\u2019t aware of. As I\u2019m spinning there is another friend who was the kid who\u2019s house we all slept at. He was still in his sleeping bag on the floor playing a gameboy or some hand held device. And I went to jump over him. Now the next part was just as unexpected for me as it was for the kids. When I landed, it forced a fart out. Which graduated into a shart. A full on graduation with honors. It magically made it out of my boxers and landed on his pillow right next to his face. Everyone said it was gross and let me tell ya. Nothing has ever stopped a hurricane in its tracks quite like that shart. I cried from embarrassment when I got home and stopped getting invited to sleep overs for a while.

I was walking around one of the mechanical shops, checking up on a project, taking notes, pictures, marking stuff off - my usual routine. Well, as I come around the corner of the vehicle, there are two mechanical engineers working on the door. I can't recall exactly what I was checking at that moment, but in my attempt to get a good look one of the engineers reached out his fist to give me a friendly morning fist bump.  \n  \nNow, I'd love to be able to say that I was tired that morning, or that I was simply too preoccupied with what I was doing. But that would be a lie.  \n  \nHere's what happened next. I lowered my clip board and my pen and I stared at his fist for a good moment. I then turned to look up towards the man's face. I stared some more. And then I turned my attention back to his fist and continued to look. The man was still holding his fist out waiting for me. But at this point my lack of response got the attention of the other engineer he was working with. And so now he was looking at me. Two engineers staring directly at me, one with his fist out, and me looking at the fist. Finally, though, I begin to outstretch my hand. However, instead of reaching out and returning the fist bump in kind, I extended my index finger. The two men's attention followed my hand. And, like a child touching a foreign substance, I pressed my finger to his fist.  \n  \nThe man slowly returned his fist. He and his partner became transfixed on the part of his hand that my finger touched. The man held his hand up to see if I left a mark. His partner joined him in looking. There was no mark. They looked back towards me. I looked at them and then smiled.  \n  \nI then made my way back to my office. I was about halfway there before I realized the absolute absurdity of my actions.

Like WW2, Korea, Vietnam, we were making valentines for a bunch of veterans and I handed mine this disgusting 2nd grader's illustration and could barely contain my own glee as I handed it off to this totally bewildered, silent old man.

She made some comment making fun of me but participated in the high five and  I went to give her a pat on the back, misjudged completely and hit her butt on accident but it didn't register until I was in the bathroom.

Or the sink'\n(Idk what was wrong with me, i was 5 cmon)\nSo like any stupid 5 year old, i pissed into the sink.\nWhilst doing so one of the teachers came in to check on me cus i was there for like 3 min. She walks in, looks at me. And she says:\n\"jesus! What are you doing!?\"\nI reply with \n\"Im trying out new things, you should too.\"\nI say this whilst having an embarassed yet happy expression. The teacher then just slowly backed away with a disgusted look, left.\nAt the same time she was leaving i felt #SO EMBARASSED\n\nShe never mentioned it to anyone.\nEven to other teachers. Things were never the same. I could never focus properly when she was around/close to me.
