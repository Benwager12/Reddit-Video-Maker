The things you personally have experienced or witnessed is very limited. Your views on love, relationships, (adult friendships), careers and the workplace, overall life stuff does not come from your offline reality.\n\nYou formed your worldview based on your parents and family + a shit load of movies, ads, social media etc  which portrays a life amped up on steroids-best-bits-edited and instagram model-filtered fairy tales.\n\nIts no wonder everyone feels like shit in their 20:s. We seen life being the FYRE festival ads.. a juiced up oversaturated life full of fun. You get there and its fema tents, poverty, food and shelter stuff waiting. Models dont want to hang out with you, they are getting paid and this life of careless party they advertise is for the suckers and consumers.\n\nAlmost no one is gonna witness something better in real life in their 20:s compared to what they been fed. Everyone gets their worldview shattered into a mushy gray zone. Where no one is really evil or entirely good. Everyone is trying to survive and figure things out. All the marketing bs you grew up with was just products. Nothing else.\n\nThe producer, actor, musician, author that created that wonderful story you want to mimic your life on doesn't have it figured out. Their life is probably just as messy as yours. Divorces, stress, physical and mental health issues, money, worries and anxiety.\n\nMy advice to 20 something people. If you stay clear from addictions, are relative healthy and can self-sustain, got standard kindness, you are killing it. You really are. Is life suppose to be like this is a question you gonna ask yourself a million times and you gonna get a million different respones.. the truth is we are all waking up putting one foot infront of the other through all stages of life totally clueless.

Lets take transport for instance. Yes driving an electric car is better than driving a petrol car, but the car still takes resources to make and ship. It doesn't look like there's anyway that electric cars will take over the markets soon enough to stop disaster. However there is an option which is far more efficient than either option which is fighting for affordable regular and wide-reaching public transport. Public transport is vastly more effecient than producing one car per person, and we can control it on a large scale through campaigning far easier than we could effect the car market. However this isn't that can be sold to you, and this isn't change that can be brought about on an individual level. You have to organise with your peers to pressure your government into spending on public transport. You have to make this change as a movement not as an individual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf we buy into \"green\" capitalism then the fight against global warming is transformed into an aesthetic that is used to sell a product. Rich libs are jerking themselves off because they bought the latest green product 200\u2122 not realising that not everyone has the option to do that, and thus not realising that they still need to actually fight the system that caused climate change. The common thing off dismissing climate change activists because they are not living 100% carbon free is so fucking dumb, **we live in a society** that runs off fosil fuel, climate change activists aren't saying that we should individually by products that produce no emissions because it is currently practically impossible to do so. Instead we are advocating changing society in such a way that living an environmental lifestyle is the easiest option and thus becomes the norm. (I.E. most people would take public transport if it was quick, regular and free).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying to throw the baby out with the bathwater and to not try and buy greener products on a personal level, but the marketing myth that this absolves you from the greater fight against climate change will get us all killed."}, {"id": "fdlk3ps", "author": "geoff5093", "score": "11", "created": "13 hours", "comment": "That Walmart advertises that they are one big happy Walmart family, and you should go work for them to join their family."}, {"id": "fdm00ol", "author": "perfidypete", "score": "11", "created": "10 hours", "comment": "That theres no harm in marketing itself, \n\ni.e. that having people constantly researching how to control your thoughts and behavior is fine because they're just trying to sell you something"}, {"id": "fdljbgw", "author": "Varvatos_Vex", "score": "6", "created": "13 hours", "comment": "You\u2019ll love pornhub premium"}, {"id": "fdlm4iq", "author": "ididitforcheese", "score": "4", "created": "12 hours", "comment": "That we are not good enough, and NEED to buy things to even aspire to be worthy of a place in society."}, {"id": "fdlwi3t", "author": "silverleaf321", "score": "5", "created": "10 hours", "comment": "That large amounts of sugar don\u2019t do damage to our bodies"}, {"id": "fdm3bqe", "author": "kg1206", "score": "4", "created": "9 hours", "comment": "That there are hot singles in my area waiting to meet me, bitch please I am the only hot single in my area, 1km away?
