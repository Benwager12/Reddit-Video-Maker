I also don\u2019t recommend any of the \u201cstarter campaigns\u201d that get bundled with the Starter Kit, Advance Kit, etc. r/dnd is a good place to go for simple one shots. \n\nSTUDY BEFORE HAND. A big mistake some DMs make is thinking they can just \u201cread along\u201d with the campaign. No. A lot of the text in a campaign is explaining to YOU how things and situations play out. A lot of the information isn\u2019t meant for the players (answers to puzzles, possible dialogue, plot spoilers for planning purposes, etc). If you don\u2019t study your campaign beforehand then your players are going to spend most of their time watching you read the book. \n\nYOU DONT NEED TO SPEND GIANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

I had one where they meant to raid a tower and go up eight flights of stairs to get into the boss room on top. Long story short they all managed to climb it and snuck in and stole the object before the boss notice them. They had amazing rolls that night.\n\n- Mr bossy\nYou get that one guy who is super controlling and he can kill the fun fast. I learned telling them at the start to work as a team or you will split them a part in campaign works. I also ask other team members directly instead of letting bossy call the shots. Side note Mr bossy will bring hard to read dice or will say an action then fail a roll and then say he wanted to do something else to reroll.\n\n-dont force roleplay\nLet players decide if they want to do their voice or play as their characters. My group normally discuss actions prior doing them and I permit it.\n\n-dont give awesome loot fast\nIf you over gear them early the fun stops. Instead give them novelty and useless loot. \n\n-rule of cool\nIf some one want to do something that is awesome but not really realistic. Like diving off a cliff to land on a dragon to stab it.

Have different personalities they meet. I had a failed wizard who could only turn objects to cheese and he would appear to help or irritate the players. They loved him a lot because he would argue with his staff about off topic things while trying to be serious.\n\n-find out what they want\nWhen I dm I always ask what do they want to do. Some want to do premade campaigns other want to base off a show or movie. Sometimes they don't know what they want and you try samples like a murder mystery, dungeon exploration etc.\n\n-no shows\nNot every one will be able to make it to the games.\nI learned to either make them do side quests or have alternative characters they play if people were missing.\n\n-respect female players\nNot sure why but when a woman players I tend to have players be flirty, rapey or belittle towards the female player while roleplaying.

I could keep going forever but this post is already getting long enough that too many people will shy away from reading it.\n\n* Don't ever take away the agency of your players. You never want to find yourself in a situation where you have to say \"I'm going to need you to kill this NPC/participate in this contest/pick up this glowing rock, or otherwise the campaign can't continue\". This is a cooperative storytelling experience, and the narrative of your actors comes first. If you need them to do a specific thing then make sure that you have a backup plan in place when they don't do it. Example: Two sessions ago I needed a dead body for something. I had a slave try to escape and then had one of his handlers gun him down with a heavy crossbow. The players had full choice in whether or not they would intervene in this, because either way I would have a dead body to work with.\n\n* Realize that not every group wants the same type of experience, and talk to your group about what they want. For example: Some players want to feel like their characters are regularly at risk of dying, where other players want a hand of god protection and a practical guarantee that they will be able to play a single character throughout the entire campaign. Some people want to meme around and sleep with bar wenches whereas other players want an actual grim and gritty experience. Find out whether your party wants to play Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Warhammer or even Adventure Time.\n\n* Don't be afraid to look silly or do things that you aren't good at. They will be fun, and you will get better at them over time. Most of us aren't voice actors, but anybody can voice act. Give your characters distinct voices and personality traits and don't be afraid to look silly when doing it. It will elevate your players to immerse themselves in their characters and become better actors themselves. Nobody ever got great at something without looking stupid doing it.\n\n* Cheat, but only when it serves the narrative. That DM screen exists for a reason: A group of wolves don't make for good players deaths, so you might just want to pretend that you didn't see the three 20's that you just rolled. Similarly, the big bad getting hit by a dominate person on the first round might not make for the conclusion that your campaign deserves. Also: Your players can't see your hit point totals. If the encounter is supposed to have narrative impact then you might just want to tell yourself \"this fight is over when I say it's over\". When it comes to boss hit points my own rule of thumb is: Once they breach the hit point total that I set for this encounter then I make sure not to kill anybody, but if the narrative asks for it then the fight will carry on. Most importantly when it comes to cheating: Don't let your players know that you cheated in the moment. If you must tell them, do so after the session.\n\n* Be flexible. The narrative of your actors comes first, and they are going to want to do a lot of things that aren't in the rulebook and that you didn't prepare for. Don't be afraid to ad-lib a dialogue or to let your players do something that isn't in the rulebook. Find ways to say 'yes' or sometimes 'yes, but' or 'yes, and'. How well you do as a game master can be measured by how often you get to say \"you absolutely can\".\n\nEDIT:\n\nOne more that I thought was deserving of this short list: The most powerful narrative tool at your disposal is time. You can take however long or however short you want when describing a certain event. You're going to find moments in your DMing career where people felt cheated out of their opportunity to tell their own story. At those moments, try to ask yourself: What could I have done to let you participate in cooperative storytelling?\n\nLet's say that the party is interrogating a bandit. The ranger decides that they have had enough and they decide to slice him in the neck. This is fine when it comes to the ranger, but what if the Paladin would have wanted to stop them from doing this?\n\nIf my ranger says \"I want to chop his head off\" and you go \"fine you do it he's dead\" then your paladin might feel cheated out of their opportunity to affect the cooperative story. If you instead say \"It is obvious from your face that you've been growing more and more annoyed at this situation. You draw your sword and approach the bandit from behind. You take a firm footing and with one fell swoop you lop his head clean off\" then you have stretched the flow of time in a way that not only makes the ranger feel more animated in the choices that they've made, but gives the paladin every opportunity to interject."}, {"id": "fdjw91f", "author": "free-tea", "score": "114", "created": "23 hours", "comment": "Being a DM (at least from my experience) requires quite a lot of improvisation, so try not to freak out when the players do something really random, which forces you to come up with something on the spot.

The rest of the group would gripe about the cultists again, nobody would be engaged, DM would doggedly move forward completely oblivious to the fact that we *hated* the cultist storyline despite vocal objection that it *always* went this way. And the hell of it was, this guy would not play as a regular player without getting drunk and complaining that the rest of the group was \"evil\" because he always had to play a lawful-good Paladin.

By all means, just let there be a hidden trapdoor instead of the portal and let them continue.\n\nAlso, make all rolls hidden, so you can cheat a little. Yes, as a GM you are allowed to cheat. But try only to cheat in favor of the players.

It's the players vs the mobs, not DM vs Players. You don't want to murder the PC the worked so hard on, It happens and it sucks, but don't TRY to. Let the dice do the talking. Your role is to tell the story, not to slaughter your players. \n\nRoll out of site of players and fudge rolls to make the game more interesting sometimes. Not always but sometimes. \n\nDon't self insert ridiculously powerful PCs for the reason of kicking players asses.  \n\nYour players will always do something that'll take you off guard. This boss that you thought would be really hard they knock out in one round, or these standard mobs kill two players. The puzzle takes them an hour to figure out and they keep asking the wrong questions. \n\n**Role play rewards.** When I DM I like to give players who role play great rewards. These rewards for the adventure I was running (Carrion Crown - Pathfinder) I would give them tarot cards which could be turned in to have two effects, each card having a different effect. My friend who DM'd  (Rise of the Ruin lords - Pathfinder) did bottle caps which could be used to modify a roll before or after it is rolled. My wife who is currently DMing (Hell's Rebels - Pathfinder) is doing Rose tokens, Which can be exchanged for various benefits. \n\n**Prep** \\- Take the time and effort to prep your game, Read over mob stats, skin through your books and make sure you look up things you might need to know or explain. Have your computer ready as your players will always ask you questions that you might not know.\n\n**Improv** \\- Dear god this is important. I played a game of D&amp;D at a comic shop because my friend wanted to check it out and asked me to come. So I made a turtle ranger and we set off on an  adventure. It was obvious this DM did  NOT PREP as he didn't have anything ready After an hour of sitting and waiting we finally start, eventually we make our way through a jungle where we come across a bloated corpse. I mention that I am a ranger who would frequent jungles, could I examine the body and see by the bloating or decomposition how long it had been dead. The DM obviously didn't think about this and started scrambling, i offered to roll something and he looked me dead in the eye and said \"What do you expect me to do, make it up?\"  **Yes. Yes I do that is how you run these games.** Needless to say is you need to prepare to have to improv and come up with things on the fly. \n\n**Pawns** \\- There are countless ways to make paper pawns for your players . Take the time do these it will make the game so much more interactive. I personally used those printable labels you can by, arranged them in word and then folded them on to card board to make figures. \n\n**Atmosphere** \\- Get some back ground ambiance, like rain or cave noises going, when a fight kicks up roll in some powerful music, when something upsetting happens slide it in to some dreary piano music. It changes the involvement of the players when the world around them feels like the world you are telling them.\n\n# The Rule Of Fun\n\nThis is the MOST important thing for DM's. The Rule Of Fun is this - If it sounds fun or interesting, figure out a way to let the player do it.  Per the rules of the game theres nothing stating that I can't ride my houses through this fight, wait until i get infront of this mob and jump off and attack this guy. **But it sounds cool.** So instead how about this - Your horse counts his own speed, if he can meet the movement to get up there I'll allow that, How ever since he is going in to battle I need you to roll handle animal to maintain control. Got it? Cool. Now Usually it's a move action to demount but I will let you jump off your horse using your move action and an acrobatics to see if you can land it. Got it? great! Now you can roll to attack but you're going to take a minus two because you're not used to jumping and attacking. Nat 20! Awesome! Roll for damage.\n\nSee instead of saying \"No, the rules say you can't jump off the horseeee\"   You now got that player hyped and ready for action - after words get the player to DESCRIBE what his PC just did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers to being a first time DM, it's burden to carry - If you ever need assistance or someone to discuss ideas with hit me up, I would be more than happy to chat with you.
