When the internet first started, it was really important not to share information about yourself. Things like email addresses and online user names were vague representations of who we wanted to project ourselves to be online - varsity\\_stud15 or cheergurl01 or whatever. Blogs were anonymous - people would frequently use pseudonyms or aliases not to give away who they were or who they were writing about.\n\nAt some point, feelings about anonymity and privacy online changed. Email addresses now are almost always a combination of first and last name. We regularly post pictures and videos of our real lives and share them with strangers online. \n\nIt's all very interesting. I'm guessing over the next 80 years, someone is going to write about the shift. As someone who was actively online during the entire transition, it's been fascinating to be part of it."}, {"author": "Jayr109", "score": "5", "created": "2 hours", "comment": "Sometime in the early/mid 2010s, 1/3 of the population of the United States lost the ability to recognize legitimate journalism and thought anything they saw on the internet was real; an event presaged by the non-fiction movie \u201cIdiocracy\u201d."}, {"author": "DrC8H10N4O2", "score": "3", "created": "2 hours", "comment": "1.
