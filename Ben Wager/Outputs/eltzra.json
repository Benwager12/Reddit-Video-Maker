You NEVER gain a true confession by any method of torture, even if it's painful or psychological.\n\nTo obtain the information you seek, you have to invest time and effort. Me? I'd place the suspected information holder in a simple cell, with a decent mattress and maybe a book, but a very boring or long winded one, say the Unabridged version of Les Miserables, or a Robert Jordan novel.\n\nThen once a day we meet and discuss things with a professional interviewer who might offer some incentive to divulge the information. We need to find out why the individual is withholding the information and break through it like an icebreaker. Are they afraid of retribution on themselves or family? Will their career be ruined? Once the fear is gone, things can progress.\n\nBut either way, any torture is bad.

College gpa, and physical altercations, tickets, drug use, everything.\n\nStep 2) limit your victim to one meal of oatmeal a day. Do this at night so that they've gone the longest without eating in their mind. \n\nStep 3) Confine them to an all white and soundproof room. Extra points if you can find the white foam stuff that cancels noise to make the room suuuuuuppper quiet.\n\nStep 4) never turn of the lights and olay a harsh beep every 30 seconds. Eventually they'll start to go crazy. \n\nStep 5) at first, offer no way out or safeword. Let them know they will suffer until you take pity and end it. After six days, bring them into a seperate room and make your deal. \n\nStep 6) in the deal room, pump smells of steak and candy, cakes, popcorn, anything. Make sure you wait to wnter until their stomach is audible.\n\nStep 7) dim the lights. After so long with bright lights, they wont be able to see well so they'll be uncomfortable.\n\nStep 8) allow contact of any sort through only 1 persone. \n\nStep 9) if they dont confess, put them back in the other room for 8 days. Offer a deal again, and if they still refuse, 11 days. Keep lengthening the time by a few days, but never have a pattern or use even numbers. It'll throw them off.\n\nStep 10) by the second round, have someone comm in when they're really struggling about how they can just end it by telling them, it'd all\nBe over if they just told, they're here on their own choice.\n\n\nVoila!
