At that beach there was a famous pizza stand that only sold small, personal-sized pizzas for $2.50, and they only opened at night, from 4 PM to 4 AM. Sidenote, everyone who worked at this place was from the same family and they were all named as some variation of Carlos (Carlos was the owner, his son was Carlos Jr., and he had two more daughters named Carla and Carlota).\n\nOne of my buddies dared me to go buy him a pizza, so I left the house and walked drunk, alone, to this pizza stand about two blocks down at 2 AM. I was at the counter when in walked this gorgeous girl. I won't say the most beautiful I've ever seen but she was very pretty, also half-drunk.\n\nNow, because of some health regulations in my country, they had to stop making the pizzas right then and there and had to pack them pre-made and ready to just cook, so whatever they had was what you got. The girl was really hungry but they only had ham pizza left, but the girl only ate kosher, so she asked if they could remove the ham. I'm Jewish too, and I know you're allowed to ignore and not follow any religious laws like eating kosher if you're in a dire situation, so I kept telling her God would forgive her if she just ate the ham. We hit it off, she ended up removing all the ham from under the cheese (thus also removing most of the cheese) and giving it to me, \"because I'm the coolest person she's ever met,\" according to her.\n\nWe kept talking for a while and I never returned to the Truth or Dare game. I ate my friend's pizza and got laid that night, but unfortunately I never saw her again."}, {"id": "fdm1cb9", "author": "SquidPoCrow", "score": "218", "created": "10 hours", "comment": "Ended up locked in a closet with my friends two older sisters who molested me and ended up raping me, I was 12.\n\nThat family was fuuuuuuucked."}, {"id": "fdm25ny", "author": "DeadRed64", "score": "82", "created": "9 hours", "comment": "Hey guys don't tell my mom but I kinda held hands with my crush back in 2nd grade..."}, {"id": "fdm2w02", "author": "kg1206", "score": "108", "created": "9 hours", "comment": "Kissed a female friend of mine for 10 minutes straight while her boyfriend was in the room.\n\nHer boyfriend was not the one who dared me however he insisted I do it because he was drunk and got all upset that I didn\u2019t wanna kiss his girlfriend thinking that I didn\u2019t think she was hot and was \u201cdisrespecting her,\u201d they are no longer dating btw.
