Everyone in the band was fully prepared to cancel the show in the wake of this unfortunate news.  However, their singer said no, and they did the show.  About halfway through their set, the lead singer announced to the crowd the news about his mom passing.  He said that his mom would have wanted him to do the show instead of cancelling.  He dedicated the next song to her and the band played \"Currents.\"  There was not a dry eye in the house.  To this day, I don't know how he sang that song without breaking down.
