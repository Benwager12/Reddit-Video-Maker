It was primarily 60+ year old women in the audience and as benefactors. The first audience question was \"How are we going to get rid of the pornography from the internet?\" and Steve Case spent 5 minutes answering and convinced  a room of geriatric old rich ladies that porn was the best thing that ever happened for technology. The basis of his argument: 1. porn is the only profitable internet business right now 2. interest in porn is requiring more bandwidth driving up ISP \"pipes\" and pushing broadband technologies 3. porn is pushing things like better compression, higher security/encryption, better image resolution and encoding, and most importantly streaming video.  4. It is also developing technologies like data centers.  \n\nPorn accelerated the internet development more than anything else. So I think having porn like rule34 is a very good thing for other things too."}, {"id": "fdk8j8u", "author": "Reaperonlybyname", "score": "334", "created": "20 hours", "comment": "I would be happy it means people enjoy my content enough that they would wanna take their time and be perverted weirdos"}, {"id": "fdkvjn1", "author": "SmartAlec105", "score": "179", "created": "17 hours", "comment": "Rebecca Sugar, the creator of Steven Universe, drew and posted Ed Edd n\u2019 Eddy porn when she was a teen.
