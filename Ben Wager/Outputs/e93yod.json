The husband had a brother(African American, he\u2019s adopted from what I remember). The mother had been in labor for around 12 hours and they were very excited to see their baby. I remember the father had been pacing my entire shift back and forth in the waiting room. When it came time to mount the mother on the table he asked the doctor if he could be in the room, he was grinning like a madman. It was a very positive energy, you could almost get completely absorbed by it. The doctor was a nice guy he let us get him some throw away scrubs and let him stay in the room. All in all the actual birthing process was pretty standard. however, when the baby came out then came the rough part. He was a normal healthy half African American boy, around 3kg. I just looked at the baby then looked at the father and watched his face go from joy to puzzlement to horror in around 10 seconds. The mother called out for her child and the doctor being all business cut and suctioned the baby. I\u2019m pretty sure at that moment the father broke because he sort of just stepped back and kept saying \u201cwhat the fuck\u201c under his breath. I didn\u2019t get to see much of them for the next 2 hours but I was there when the mother was brought to her room. Her husband and his brother were there as well and she was talking to them. From what I saw she was trying to console her husband and his brother was trying to hug him. The husband kind of just kept shrugging off his brothers arms and crying into his hands. It was a really tough thing to see, but all in all it wasn\u2019t really as dramatic as you\u2019d expect."}, {"author": "ChloeJayde", "score": "1.0k", "created": "5 hours", "comment": "My mum's friend has three sons to her ex husband.

Nut and Mary were close, but Mary got held back because Mary got pregnant and therefore had to temporarily stop studying. During that time, me and Nut became interns, and Nut began hanging out often with another girl named Bell. Nut and Bell weren't *that* close or physical with each other, so it came as a surprise when 2 months before internship ended, we found out that Bell was pregnant. Turns out that the two were fuck buddies the entire time. Anyway, they graduated, and eventually Bell gave birth to a baby boy, who looked like Nut's miniature clone. It was as of the baby got *nothing* out of the mother. At all. Some of us even joked that Nut's seed was just *that* strong that he doesn't create offspring, he creates clones.\n\nNow, Mary eventually caught up with her studies, and entered junior internship so she got to rotate with some of us. And when she showed us the picture of *her* baby boy, he also looked. Exactly. Like. Nut.\n\nNote that we knew what Mary's husband looked like, and what Mary's daughter looked like. Her son looked just like Nut. So much that if you placed her son beside Bell's, you could easily mistake them as twins (we did just that).\n\nNot sure what happened to them now (I moved to a nearby hospital, but I never really talked to any of the three) but last I heard from Nut's and my mutual friend, Nut's partner (he claimed he won't marry her) and son were left in a city around 4 hours away (Bell worked there), Mary's husband, daughter, and son were in the US (Mary's husband was studying aeronautics or smth similar), and Nut and Mary were on duty the same day at the same hospital."}, {"author": "Ganglebot", "score": "245", "created": "3 hours", "comment": "My cousin has dark skin.
